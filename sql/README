To build a database with this schema, use ../bin/obd-create.pl

MATERIALIZED VIEWS:

views are non-materialized to being with. To materialize selected views, use "make" to build the mv DDL. Then just pipe that in via psql.

E.g.:
   psql -a -h localhost -p 9999 obd_phenotype_200805 < obd-core-views-mv.sql >& LOG

May take a while & increase db storage space an order of magnitude.

To return to normal views:

  psql>   SELECT drop_all_matviews();
  shell>  psql -a -h localhost -p 9999 obd_phenotype_200805 < obd-core-views.sql
