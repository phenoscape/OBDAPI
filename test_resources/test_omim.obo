comment: DESCRIPTION BMP4 is a vital regulatory molecule that functions throughout development in mesoderm induction, tooth development, limb formation, bone induction, and fracture repair. It is overexpressed in patients with fibrodysplasia ossificans progressiva (FOP; 135100). GENE FUNCTION Shafritz et al. (1996) found overexpression of BMP4 in lymphoblastoid cell lines from 26 of 32 patients with FOP, but from only 1 of 12 normal subjects (P less than 0.001). Furthermore, BMP4 and its mRNA were detected in the lymphoblastoid cell lines from a man with FOP and his 3 affected children, but not from the children's unaffected mother. Cosegregation of DNA markers for the BMP4 locus on chromosome 14 in the rare families in which FOP is inherited would strengthen the candidacy of BMP4, and the demonstration of mutations in the BMP4 gene, especially in the promoter sequences, would be confirmatory. In a series of expression studies in mouse, Tucker et al. (1998) demonstrated that BMP4 activates the expression of Msx1 (142983), leading to incisor tooth development. BMP4 inhibited expression of Barx1 (603260), which marks presumptive molar teeth, and limits expression to the proximal, presumptive molar mesenchyme at embryonic day 10. Fibroblast growth factor-8 (FGF8; 600483) stimulated Barx1 expression. When BMP4 signaling in early development was inhibited by application of exogenous noggin (NOG; 602991) protein, ectopic Barx1 expression resulted in transformation of tooth identity from incisor to molar. Dlx1 (600029) and Dlx2 (126255) are involved in the patterning of murine dentition, since loss of these transcription factors results in early developmental failure in upper molar teeth. Thomas et al. (2000) found that Bmp4 was coexpressed with Dlx2 in distal oral epithelium and that it regulated Dlx2 expression by planar signaling. They presented evidence that Bmp4 and Fgf8 cooperate and regulate the strict expression of Dlx2 in the epithelium and the mesenchyme in the first branchial arch in developing mice. Dooley et al. (2000) investigated the effect of BMP4 on androgen production in a human ovarian theca-like tumor (HOTT) cell culture model. BMP4 decreased forskolin-stimulated HOTT cell secretion of androstenedione and 17-alphahydroxyprogesterone (17OHP) by 50% but increased progesterone production 3-fold above forskolin treatment alone. BMP4 markedly inhibited forskolin stimulation of CYP17 (see 202110) expression but had little effect on 3-beta-HSD (see 109715), CYP11A1 (118485), or STAR (600617) protein levels. The authors identified the presence of mRNA for 3 BMP receptors in the HOTT cells model: BMPR1A (601299), BMPR1B (603248), and BMPR2 (600799). The authors concluded that BMP4 inhibits HOTT cell expression of CYP17, leading to an alteration of the steroidogenic pathway resulting in reduced androstenedione accumulation and increased progesterone production. They also noted that the effects of BMP4 seem similar to those caused by activin (see 147290), another member of the transforming growth factor-beta superfamily of proteins. In chick embryos, the first signs of left-right asymmetry are detected in Hensen's node, essentially by left-sided Sonic hedgehog (SHH; 600725) expression. After a gap of several hours, Shh induces polarized gene activities in the left paraxial mesoderm. Monsoro-Burq and Le Douarin (2001) showed that during this time period, Bmp4 signaling is necessary and sufficient to maintain Shh asymmetry within the node. Shh and Bmp4 proteins negatively regulate each other's transcription, resulting in a strict complementarity between these 2 gene patterns on each side of the node. Noggin, which is present in the midline at this stage, limits Bmp4 spreading. Moreover, Bmp4 is downstream to activin signals and controls Fgf8. Thus, the authors concluded that early Bmp4 signaling coordinates left and right pathways in Hensen's node. Chen et al. (2002) studied BMP4 gene transfer and osteoinduction by BMP4 using an adenoviral vector to transduce mouse myoblast cells. BMP4 expressed by transduced myoblasts was located in the cytoplasm, and the differentiation pathway utilized by these cells was converted from a myogenic to an osteogenic pathway. Injection of the adenoviral vector carrying BMP4 into the hindlimb muscles of male athymic nude rats resulted in new bone formation that could be visualized on x-ray films as early as 3 weeks post injection. Histologic staining of bone tissue revealed a typical remodeled bone structure. Cheng et al. (2003) measured the ability of 14 human BMPs to induce osteogenic transformation in a mouse pluripotential stem cell line, a mouse mesenchymal stem cell line, and a mature human osteoblastic cell line. Osteogenic activity was determined by measuring induction of alkaline phosphatase (see 171760), osteocalcin (112260), and matrix mineralization upon BMP stimulation. All BMPs were able to stimulate alkaline phosphatase activity in the mature osteoblasts. BMP4 was able to induce all markers of osteoblast differentiation in pluripotential and mesenchymal stem cells; however, BMP4 was a weaker inducer than BMP2 (112261), BMP6 (112266), and BMP9 (GDF2; 605120). Paez-Pereda et al. (2003) stated that there is little doubt that estrogens and growth factors are involved in the control of lactotroph cell proliferation in the pituitary and that the tumorigenic action of estrogen in prolactinomas had been demonstrated by in vitro and clinical evidence. Thus, the number of lactotroph cells increases during pregnancy. Prolactinomas occur more frequently in women and increase in size during pregnancy or estrogen treatment, and, at least in human prolactinomas, estrogen receptor expression is positively related to size. Paez-Pereda et al. (2003) reported a previously undescribed mechanism for prolactinoma growth that involved BMP4, SMAD4 (600993), and estrogens. By in situ hybridization, Zhu et al. (2004) found overlapping expression of Bmp4 and Nkx2.1 (600635) in embryonic mouse lung. They presented evidence that Nkx2.1 activated Bmp4 transcription through 2 Nkx2.1 elements in each of the 2 Bmp4 promoters. Haramis et al. (2004) used mouse models to demonstrate that BMP4 expression occurs exclusively in the intravillus mesenchyme of the intestine. Villus epithelial cells respond to the BMP signal. Inhibition of BMP signaling by transgenic expression of noggin results in the formation of numerous ectopic crypt units perpendicular to the crypt-villus axis. These changes phenocopy the intestinal histopathology of patients with the cancer predisposition syndrome juvenile polyposis (174900), including the frequent occurrence of intraepithelial neoplasia. Many juvenile polyposis cases are known to harbor mutations in BMP pathway genes. Haramis et al. (2004) concluded that their data indicated that intestinal BMP signaling represses de novo crypt formation and polyp growth. GENE STRUCTURE The transcriptional unit of the human BMP4 gene is encoded by 5 exons and spans approximately 7 kb (van den Wijngaard et al., 1996). The human BMP4 gene has at least 2 functional promoters, which are used in a cell type-specific manner. Shore et al. (1998) determined that alternate first exons may be used and that the first 2 exons are untranslated. The promoter region is GC-rich and contains no obvious TATA or CAAT consensus sequences. Both positive and negative transcriptional regulatory elements are contained within the 5-prime flanking region. MAPPING Dickinson et al. (1990) demonstrated that in the mouse the Bmp2b1 gene is located on chromosome 14 and maps to the same area as 'pug nose' (pn). The mutation in the latter disorder may reside in the Bmp-2b1 gene. Arguing from homology of synteny, Dickinson et al. (1990) suggested that the human BMP2B1 gene may be located on chromosome 14. Furthermore, they suggested that a human homolog of the murine Bmp2b2 gene resides on the X chromosome, as it does in the mouse. There is, however, no direct evidence of a second BMP2B gene in the human (McAlpine, 1992). By analysis of human/rodent somatic cell hybrids, Tabas et al. (1993) assigned the BMP4 gene to human chromosome 14. Using fluorescence in situ hybridization, van den Wijngaard et al. (1995) localized the BMP4 gene to 14q22-q23. By FISH, Shore et al. (1998) mapped the BMP4 gene to chromosome 14q21, a region more centromeric than previously reported. ANIMAL MODEL Connor (1996) speculated that transgenic mice with selective overexpression of BMP4 may serve as animal models of fibrodysplasia ossificans progressiva (FOP) and may make it possible to evaluate potential therapies directed at influencing the expression of BMP4 or its 2 types of cell-surface receptors. Not only may this knowledge provide a rational basis for therapy for FOP, but possibly also measures for the control of local ectopic bone development, which occurs in 10 to 20% of patients who have undergone surgical hip replacement. According to Connor (1996), there appears to be an individual propensity to the phenomenon of secondary ectopic ossification of soft tissue. In the 10 to 20% of patients who develop local ectopic bone formation after hip replacement, if surgical removal of that bone is attempted or the opposite hip is replaced, ectopic bone almost invariably recurs or occurs. Using a hypomorphic Bmp4 allele and conditional gene inactivation, Jiao et al. (2003) circumvented the early lethality of Bmp4 null mouse embryos and manipulated Bmp4 expression specifically in developing cardiomyocytes. They found that Bmp4 was dispensable for cushion formation but was required for proper atrioventricular septation after cushions had formed. Defects in septation caused atrioventricular canal defects (AVCD; 600309) that recapitulated the range of AVCDs diagnosed in patients. Kan et al. (2004) generated mice overexpressing BMP4 under the control of the neuron-specific enolase promoter (ENO2; 131360) and observed the development of progressive postnatal heterotopic endochondral ossification, a phenotype that matches the anatomic, spatial, and temporal characteristics of human FOP. The phenotype was completely rescued in double-transgenic mice that also overexpressed the BMP4 inhibitor noggin, confirming the role of BMP4 in the pathogenesis of the disease.

comment: Lee et al. (1982) described a 38-year-old woman and her 8-year-old son who had low birth weight for dates and retarded postnatal growth, bilateral branchial cleft sinuses, congenital strabismus, obstructed nasolacrimal ducts, broad nasal bridge, protruding upper lip, and carp mouth. Graying of the mother's hair occurred at age 18. Intelligence was normal. The same disorder may have been reported by Hall et al. (1983) and Fujimoto et al. (1987). Hall et al. (1983) described 2 unrelated children (1 male, 1 female) with hemangiomatous branchial clefts and pseudocleft of the upper lip (resembling a surgically repaired cleft or a fused cleft). They found reports of 2 additional patients who, they suspected, also represented sporadic cases of this syndrome. In several persons in 3 families, Fujimoto et al. (1987) observed an autosomal dominant disorder of abnormal upper lip, which resembled a poorly repaired median cleft lip, malformed nose with broad bridge and flattened tip, lacrimal duct obstruction, malformed ears, and branchial cleft sinuses and/or linear skin lesions behind the ears. In each of the 3 families an affected parent had at least 1 affected child, and father-to-son transmission was observed in 1. Other anomalies included coloboma, microphthalmia, auricular pits, lip pits, highly arched palate, dental anomalies, and subcutaneous cysts of the scalp. Premature graying of hair occurred in affected adults. The abnormality of the upper lip might be described as an unusually broad and prominent philtrum. Mazzone et al. (1992) reported a patient who, in addition to typical features of BOFS, had partial agenesis of the cerebellar vermis. Lin et al. (1992) concluded that the father and son reported by Legius et al. (1990) had the BOF syndrome and that this additional finding of male-to-male transmission confirmed autosomal dominant inheritance. Fielding and Fryer (1992) described 2 sibs with this syndrome, each of whom also had orbital hemangiomatous cysts. Both parents were clinically normal and unrelated. Thus this may have represented an autosomal recessive form of the disorder or germline mosaicism for the dominant gene. Schmerler et al. (1992) reviewed the development of an affected child over a 12-year period of observation. Normal intelligence, regular class placement, hypernasal speech, and continued growth along the third centile were noted. The infant had been referred at the age of 5 months for evaluation of his facial appearance and 'burn-like' lesions behind both ears. McCool and Weaver (1994) observed the BOF syndrome in a mother and her son who lacked the ocular and branchial abnormalities but had bilateral supraauricular sinuses and hearing loss. The son had bilateral cleft lip and right alveolar cleft; the mother had asymmetric nostrils and upper lip. The supraauricular sinuses were thought to represent persistence of the otic vesicle sinus tract. Lin et al. (1995) described 15 new cases of the BOF syndrome and reviewed previously reported cases (28 with typical and 5 with atypical manifestations) in detail. Postauricular cervical branchial defects were found in 40 of 43 patients, and supraauricular defects were found in 6. Pathologic findings of the excised branchial defects showed thymic remnants in several cases. Colobomata were found in 16 of 35 patients, cataracts in 8 of 33, deafness in 14 of 38, scalp cysts in 4 of 38, and premature graying of hair in 9 of 38. Pseudoclefts were observed in 23 patients, and cleft lip and/or palate in 20. Urologic examination of 19 patients revealed kidney abnormalities (agenesis, cysts, hydronephrosis) in 7. Autosomal dominant inheritance of the BOF syndrome is supported by a 3-generation German family, 2 instances of father-to-son transmission, and 7 other parent-offspring families (Fujimoto et al., 1987; Lin et al., 1995). Richardson et al. (1996) described a boy with cleft lip and palate, microphthalmos, colobomata of optic nerves and irides, and cystic dysplasia of the left kidney. His mother had similar ocular abnormalities (plus polycoria), obstruction of nasolacrimal ducts, bifid nasal tip, abnormal philtrum, hypodontia, and premature graying of the hair. His maternal grandmother had the same facial defects and nasolacrimal duct obstruction, but normal eyes. The spectrum of abnormalities in this family fits the BOF syndrome, although cervical hemangiomata or branchial sinuses were not found in affected persons in this family. McGaughran (2001) described a 1-year-old male with BOF syndrome together with preaxial polydactyly and a white forelock at birth. The author stated that this was only the second case in which preaxial polydactyly had been described in the branchiooculofacial syndrome. Demirci et al. (2005) reported the ocular manifestations of BOF syndrome in a 10-year-old girl who had undergone excision of an orbital dermoid cyst and branchial cleft fistula at age 4 years. At age 10, she had sinus tracts on each side of the nose, connecting the lacrimal sac to the skin. In addition, she had an iris pigment epithelial cyst in one eye and a combined hamartoma of the retina and retinal pigment epithelium in the other. Although BOF syndrome and branchiootorenal (BOR) syndrome (113650) are sufficiently distinctive that they should not be confused, both can be associated with nasolacrimal duct stenosis, deafness, prehelical pits, malformed pinna, and renal anomalies. Furthermore, Legius et al. (1990) reported father and son with features of both conditions. In light of these issues, Lin et al. (2000) performed a mutation search of the EYA1 gene in 5 BOF syndrome patients and found no EYA1 mutations, suggesting that BOF syndrome is not allelic to the BOR syndrome. Lin et al. (2000) emphasized that the unusual areas of thin, erythematous wrinkled skin of the neck or infra/supraauricular region of BOF syndrome differ from the discrete cervical pits, cysts, and fistulas of the BOR syndrome.

comment: A number sign (#) is used with this entry because of evidence that the disorder results from mutation in the EYA1 gene (601653). Melnick et al. (1976) described a family in which the father and 3 of 6 living children (a son and 2 daughters) had mixed hearing loss associated with a Mondini-type cochlear malformation (hypoplasia of cochlear apex shown by tomography) and stapes fixation, cup-shaped, anteverted pinnae, bilateral prehelical pits, bilateral branchial cleft fistulas, and bilateral renal dysplasia with anomalies of the collecting system. The father and affected son had aplasia of the lacrimal ducts also. A fourth child, who died at 5 months of age, was said to have had branchial cleft fistulas and bilateral polycystic kidneys. Conditions in the same nosoembryologic community were discussed. Fitch and Srolovitz (1976) reported a woman with preauricular pits, cervical fistulae, and partial deafness who gave birth to 2 children with preauricular pits and severe renal dysgenesis. Fraser et al. (1978) described a kindred with the BOR syndrome. Lacrimal duct stenosis occurs in some. Fraser et al. (1980) suggested that the frequency of the BOR syndrome may be higher than generally realized. Of 421 white children in Montreal schools for the deaf, 19 had preauricular pits. The BOR syndrome was identified in 4 of the 9 families that agreed to family investigations, including audiograms and intravenous pyelograms. They estimated that about 6% of heterozygotes have severe renal dysplasia and that a preauricular pit at birth suggests that the child has at least 1 chance in 200 of severe hearing loss. Melnick et al. (1978) maintained that the BOR syndrome is distinct from branchiootic dysplasia (BO syndrome; 602588) because in the latter condition renal anomaly is absent and deafness is not a constant feature. Cremers and Fikkers-van Noord (1980) concluded, however, that the BOR syndrome and the BO syndrome are one entity. After linkage of BOR to 8q13 (see later) was demonstrated, Kumar et al. (1998) investigated the BO syndrome in a large family to determine whether BOR and BO syndromes are allelic. No linkage was found to the 8q13 region, indicating that they are not allelic. The question of whether branchiootorenal dysplasia and the branchiootic syndrome are allelic appears to have been settled by the finding of mutations in the EYA1 gene in both disorders. See 601653.0003. See also 113600 and 113650. Carmi et al. (1983) observed a man with the BOR syndrome and crossed renal ectopia who fathered 3 children born with bilateral renal agenesis and the Potter syndrome. Preisch et al. (1985) reported affected father, son and daughter. The father and daughter showed tearing with eating, i.e., gustatory lacrimation (GL). The father had absent reflex tearing in one eye and GL in the other. The daughter's GL was apparently also unilateral. Another family was said to show the phenomenon. GL, sometimes described as 'crocodile tears,' is said by Gorlin (1976) to have been observed in over 100 cases but never in multiple members of families. Most cases are unilateral and often follow facial trauma or surgery but can occur as a congenital defect in innervation as was probably the case in this family. Heimler and Lieber (1986) observed a family in which some persons had duplication of the collecting system as the renal anomaly, others had branchial and ear anomalies with normal kidneys, and yet others had complete failure of penetrance. Legius et al. (1990) described father and son with a branchial cleft syndrome mixing characteristics of the BOR syndrome with those of the branchiooculofacial syndrome (BOFS; 113620). The 2 subjects showed several anomalies common to both syndromes, namely, abnormally shaped ears with deafness, cervical fistulae, preauricular ear pits, and lacrimal duct stenosis. Unilateral renal hypoplasia and dysplasia in the son were typical of the BOR syndrome. On the other hand, cleft palate and mild 'mental problems' in the father, and bilateral microphthalmia and high-arched palate in the son are characteristic of the BOF syndrome. Neither the father nor the son showed the findings that are more or less constant in BOFS: lip 'pseudoclefts,' abnormal nose, premature graying, or skin abnormalities. The father had been operated on for arteria lusoria (left subclavian artery passing behind the esophagus) causing dysphagia. He had also had unexplained atrial fibrillation. Lin et al. (1992) concluded that the patients of Legius et al. (1990) indeed had the BOF syndrome and that this entity is distinct from the BOR syndrome. Legius and Fryns (1992) remained dubious of a distinction. Chitayat et al. (1992) made the diagnosis of BOR syndrome in a woman who had had 2 pregnancies complicated by oligohydramnios due to renal hypoplasia and agenesis. Both babies died neonatally of pulmonary hypoplasia. Histopathology of the temporal bones of the second child showed marked immaturity of the middle ear cleft, ossicles, facial nerve and canal, and cochlear nerve. The mother's renal ultrasound study was normal although intravenous pyelography indicated renal hypoplasia. The mother had a hearing problem first recognized at age 5 when abnormality of the right ossicular mass and antral region was found. A preauricular pit on the right in the mother was pictured. Chen et al. (1995) described the phenotype in 45 individuals, highlighting differences and similarities to findings reported by others. Characteristic temporal bone findings included hypoplasia of the cochlea, which was four-fifths of normal size with only 2 turns, dilation of the vestibular aqueduct, bulbous internal auditory canals, deep posterior fossa, and acutely angled promontories. They pictured a 3-generation family with various manifestations. Graham and Allanson (1999) described a 14-month-old girl with unilateral congenital cholesteatoma (604183) and anomalies of the facial nerve, in addition to the branchial arch, otic, and renal malformations that comprise the BOR syndrome. The mother also had the BOR syndrome and unilateral duplication of the facial nerve. This was said to be the first study of a BOR patient with congenital cholesteatoma and the second family in which cholesteatoma and anomalies of the facial nerve were described in patients with BO/BOR syndrome. It is noteworthy that preauricular skin tags and/or pits constitute the most consistent feature of the cat eye syndrome (115470) and that renal malformations, such as unilateral absence, unilateral or bilateral hypoplasia, and cystic dysplasia, are frequent. Schinzel et al. (1981) concluded that trisomy or tetrasomy of 22pter-q11 is the usual basis of the cat eye syndrome. Is the BOR gene in this chromosomal segment? The answer is no for the majority of cases which map to 8q and have demonstrable mutations in the EYA1 gene (601653). In an extensively affected Australian family, Haan et al. (1989) found many members who had a complex inherited rearrangement of 8q associated with both trichorhinophalangeal syndrome (190350) and the branchiootic syndrome. Preauricular pits or branchial sinuses were present in all 8 members studied in detail; 7 of these had deafness, the exception being the youngest. Three breakpoints in 8q were identified. One of them was consistent with the previously assigned location of the gene for the trichorhinophalangeal syndrome. Haan et al. (1989) suggested that the branchiootic syndrome is caused by mutation at one or the other breakpoints, either 8q13.3 or 8q21.13. Confirmatory evidence that the BOR gene is located on 8q was provided by Kumar et al. (1992), who found linkage to genetic markers in that region in a 4-generation family; maximum lod = 4.0 at theta = 0.05 with the D8S165 microsatellite marker. The availability of linkage information now permits determination as to whether the branchiootorenal dysplasia is determined by mutation at the same locus as the branchiootic syndrome and the syndrome designated as the branchiootoureteral syndrome by Fraser et al. (1983) on the basis of a family in which renal involvement was limited to duplication of the collecting system and bifid renal pelves. In the 4-generation family of Heimler and Lieber (1986), the phenotype was that of branchiootic syndrome in some persons and branchiootoureteral syndrome in others. By multipoint analysis in 2 families, Smith et al. (1992) found a maximum lod score of 3.79 at theta = 0.084 for location of BOR telomeric to a marker at 8q12-q13. The diagnosis of BOR syndrome was based on the presence of at least 2 of the following features: preauricular pits, lop-ear deformity, branchial fistulae, hearing loss, and renal anomalies. Wang et al. (1994), who referred to this disorder alternatively as the Melnick-Fraser syndrome, used multipoint linkage analysis based on microsatellite markers (Weissenbach et al., 1992) to map the BOR gene to a region of 8q flanked by D8S543 and D8S84. The interval between these 2 markers was estimated to be 6 cM. Ni et al. (1994) concluded that BOR is flanked by D8S530 and D8S279. Based on multipoint analysis using a set of 13 polymorphic markers from the BOR region in 2 large, clinically well-characterized families, Kumar et al. (1996) concluded that the BOR gene is between markers D8S543 and D8S530, a distance of about 2 cM. They identified YACs that map in the critical region and characterized them by fluorescence in situ hybridization and pulsed field gel electrophoresis. Gu et al. (1996) made use of a cell line from one of the affected members of the family reported by Haan et al. (1989) with both BO and trichorhinophalangeal syndrome I. YACs spanning the BOR interval from D8S543 to D8S541 were used as fluorescence in situ hybridization probes. In addition to the cytogenetically defined direct insertion of material from 8q13.3-q21.13 into 8q24.11, a previously unidentified deletion of just under 1 megabase was found in 8q13.3. These data narrowed the most likely location of the BOR gene to a region corresponding to the proximal two-thirds of YAC 869E10 between D8S543 and D8S279. Kalatzis et al. (1996) likewise used the cell line first described by Haan et al. (1989) and identified an associated deletion by fluorescence in situ hybridization analysis of the 8q translocation breakpoint. The generation of a YAC contig and the isolation of overlapping recombinant P1 and lambda phage clones from the region allowed further characterization of the deletion. Its size was estimated to be between 470 and 650 kb, and it was flanked by the polymorphic markers D8S1060 and D8S1807. See 600257 for a discussion of the BOR-Duane-hydrocephalus contiguous gene syndrome as described by Vincent et al. (1994). By positional cloning, Abdelhak et al. (1997) identified a candidate gene for BOR syndrome at 8q13.3 and showed that mutations in the gene (e.g., 601653.0001) underlie the disorder. The gene is a human homolog of the Drosophila 'eyes absent' gene (eya); the human gene was symbolized EYA1. They also found a highly conserved 271-amino acid C-terminal region in the products of 2 other human genes, which were subsequently called EYA2 (601654) and EYA3 (601655), demonstrating the existence of a novel gene family. The expression pattern of the murine EYA1 ortholog, Eya1, suggested a role in the development of all components of the inner ear, from the emergence of the otic placode. In the developing kidney, the expression pattern was indicative of a role for Eya1 in the metanephric cells surrounding the 'just-divided' ureteric branches. Stratakis et al. (1998) studied an extended family with autosomal dominant inheritance of branchial arch anomalies, hearing loss, and ear pits, but no affected members who had renal abnormalities or lacrimal duct stenosis. Among the 15 affected members studied, ear pits were present in all, whereas hearing loss and other branchial arch anomalies were present in 40% and 20%, respectively. Linkage analysis yielded lod scores less than -2 for linkage to the 8q13.3 locus. Thus this appears to provide evidence that some instances of the BOR syndrome are due to mutations in genes other than the EYA1 gene (601653). Rickard et al. (2000) studied 32 individuals with BOR syndrome or an overlapping phenotype. Eighteen of the cases had what the authors classified as classic BOR syndrome, exhibiting at least 3 of the major features: hearing loss, branchial defects, ear pits, and renal anomalies. Twelve cases had 1 or 2 major clinical features and were designated as having an atypical form of the condition. Two cases had otofaciocervical syndrome (166780). Mutations in the EYA1 gene were found in 11 of 18 cases of classic BOR syndrome. There were no apparent clinical differences between those with and those without EYA1 mutations. No mutations were detected in any subjects with atypical BOR syndrome or OFC syndrome. Vervoort et al. (2002) noted that in up to one-half of reported cases of BOR syndrome, EYA1 screening was negative, suggesting genetic heterogeneity. Using SSCP and direct sequencing, they screened the coding region of the EYA1 gene in a panel of BOR families linked to chromosome 8. Only 1 point mutation in 5 probands was detected. However, using Southern blot analysis, complex rearrangements such as inversions and large deletions were identified in the other 4 patients. Vervoort et al. (2002) concluded that more complex rearrangements may have been missed in earlier studies, which commonly used only SSCP and sequencing for mutation detection. Chang et al. (2004) sought to refine the clinical diagnosis of BOR syndrome by analyzing phenotypic data from families segregating EYA1 disease-causing mutations. They presented diagnostic criteria in the form of a list of major and minor criteria and suggested that an affected individual must have at least 3 major criteria, 2 major criteria and at least 2 minor criteria, or 1 major criterion and an affected first-degree relative meeting criteria for BOR syndrome.

comment: See 114220. The calpains, or calcium-activated neutral proteases (EC 3.4.22.17), are nonlysosomal intracellular cysteine proteases. The mammalian calpains include 2 ubiquitous proteins, CAPN1 (114220) and CAPN2 (114230), as well as 2 stomach-specific proteins, and CAPN3, which is muscle-specific. The ubiquitous enzymes consist of heterodimers with distinct large subunits associated with a common small subunit, all of which are encoded by different genes. The association of tissue-specific large subunits with a small subunit has not yet been demonstrated. The large subunits of calpains can be subdivided into 4 domains; domains I and III, whose functions remain unknown, show no homology with known proteins. The former, however, may be important for the regulation of the proteolytic activity. Domain II shows similarity with other cysteine proteases, which share histidine, cysteine, and asparagine residues at their active sites. Domain IV comprises 4 EF-hand structures that are potential calcium-binding sites. In addition, 3 unique regions with no known homology are present in the muscle-specific CAPN protein, namely NS, IS1, and IS2, the latter containing a nuclear translocation signal (Sorimachi et al., 1989). These regions may be important for the muscle-specific function of CAPN3. Richard et al. (1995) demonstrated that the CAPN3 gene (symbolized CANP3 by them) consists of 24 exons and extends over 40 kb. Ohno et al. (1989) mapped the CAPN3 gene to chromosome 15. In the course of detailed genetic and physical mapping of the region of chromosome 15 containing the gene for limb-girdle muscular dystrophy type 2A (LGMD2A; 253600), candidate genes for LGMD2A were isolated. The CAPN3 gene was a particularly attractive candidate because of its functional role in muscle. By a mutation screen in LGMD2A families, Richard et al. (1995) identified 15 nonsense, splice site, frameshift, or missense CAPN3 mutations cosegregating with the disease (see 114240.0001, 114240.0002, and 114240.0003). Six of these were found within an inbred population of Reunion islanders, and haplotype analysis suggested the existence of at least 1 more mutation in the group. The occurrence of multiple independent events in other small populations had been reported for the Hurler syndrome (607014) by Bach et al. (1993) and for metachromatic leukodystrophy (250100) by Heinisch et al. (1995). Richard et al. (1995) suggested that the problem, which they referred to as the 'Reunion paradox,' could be due to the fact that this condition, which had been considered a monogenic disorder, has a more complex inheritance pattern in which expression of the calpain mutations is dependent on genetic background, either nuclear or mitochondrial. Consider, for instance, a digenic model: only in the presence of specific alleles at a permissive second unlinked locus (e.g., a compensatory, partially redundant, regulatory, or modifier gene) would there be expression of calpain mutations. Since one would need mutations at both loci to be affected, the disease prevalence would remain low. Under this model, members of the Reunion island community would, as a result of genetic drift, have a disease-associated allele at the hypothesized second locus at high frequency (or even fixed in this small population), conditions that would explain the apparent complete penetrance of the calpain mutations. Complete penetrance of this disease in the Amish and in the other described LGMD2A pedigrees would also be under control of the second locus. If this model is true, there may be fewer selected pressures against the appearance of CAPN3 mutations, as a result of the conditional penetrance. In other words, the frequency of the calpain variants in the overall population may be much higher than initially deduced, based on the estimates of the prevalence of the disease under a simple monogenic model. Under this model, some of the families in which the LGMD2A locus was previously excluded based on linkage analyses (assuming simple monogenic inheritance) might be authentic LGMD2A families, reflecting differential segregation of the 2 unlinked genes. The digenic inheritance model would predict that in a number of kindreds, there will be healthy individuals with 2 mutant calpain genes. (Digenic inheritance of retinitis pigmentosa (608133) has been reported; see 180721 and 179605.) Zlotogora et al. (1996) suggested that the occurrence of multiple mutations in the calpain gene among Reunion Island patients may be an example of a high mutation rate in the gene coupled with selective advantage to carriers. Beckmann (1996) offered rebuttal to this explanation of the 'Reunion paradox' and defended their previously reported digenic model. He stated that to that time a total of 7 distinct calpain mutations had been identified among Reunion Island patients with limb girdle muscular dystrophy. For further discussion of the 'Reunion paradox' see 114200.0001 and Pratt et al. (1997). Richard et al. (1997) studied 21 LGMD2 pedigrees of various origins: France, Israel, Lebanon, Switzerland, United States, Italy, and Turkey. Nine of the 23 families showed linkage to chromosome 15, whereas such linkage was excluded in 10 and was inconclusive in 4. A search for CAPN3 mutations uncovered 19 novel mutations in addition to the 16 described previously. A survey of clinical features showed great variability. All patients showed elevated serum creatine kinase in a range of 7 to 84 times the upper limit of normal, marked intra- and interfamilial phenotypic variability in age of onset (range 2.5 to 40 years), and loss of ambulation. For example, affected individuals in 1 family presented with a very mild phenotype, with onset at ages 30 and 40 years, and were still ambulatory at ages 54 and 66 years, respectively. In contrast, 2 Lebanese sibs had onset at age 6 years and had loss of independent walking at ages 13 years and 15 years. See also 114240.0004. Prior to the identification of CAPN3 as the defective gene in LGMD2A, all identified molecular mechanisms in muscular dystrophies had involved structural components of muscle. CAPN3 appears to have a very rapid turnover mediated by autocatalysis, possibly reflecting the need for precise regulation of its activity. Furthermore, CAPN3 shows a nuclear localization, possibly mediated by the nuclear translocation signal in the IS2 region. Richard et al. (1995) favored the idea that the CAPN3 protein is involved in the control of gene expression by regulating the turnover or activity of transcription factors or of their inhibitors. To elucidate the molecular mechanism of LGMD2A, Ono et al. (1998) constructed 9 CAPN3 missense point mutations and analyzed the unique properties of the product p94. All mutants completely or almost completely lost proteolytic activity against a potential substrate, fodrin. However, some of the mutants still possessed autolytic activity and/or connectin/titin (TTN; 188840)-binding ability, indicating that these properties are not necessary for the LGMD2A phenotype. These results provided strong evidence that LGMD2A results from the loss of proteolysis of substrates by p94, suggesting a novel molecular mechanism leading to muscular dystrophies. Richard and Beckmann (1996) found that the mouse Canp3 gene encodes an mRNA of a size similar to the human CANP3 mRNA. The mouse gene directs the synthesis of an 821-amino acid protein. Results obtained from a somatic cell hybrid panel indicated the localization on mouse chromosome 2 or chromosome 4 but did not allow distinction between these 2 chromosomes, since all hybrids carrying mouse chromosome 2 also carried chromosome 4. The fact that isolated murine YACs amplified a sequence tagged site (STS) for the TYRO3 gene (600341), which maps to human chromosome 15, suggested to Richard and Beckmann (1996) that the 2 genes are adjacent in the mouse. Homology between mouse chromosome 2 and human chromosome 15 is well established by a number of examples of synteny; no homology of synteny has been demonstrated between human 15 and mouse 4. Fanin et al. (2005) identified mutations in the CAPN3 gene in 70 (33%) of 214 patients with limb-girdle muscular dystrophy in Italy. The prevalence of LGMD2A was estimated at 9.47 per million inhabitants in northeastern Italy. Two founder mutations were identified (114240.0009; 114240.0010). Zatz and Starling (2005) reviewed the roles of calpains in disease with specific reference to the etiologic role of mutations in CAPN3 in LGMD2A. By high-throughput denaturing HPLC, Piluso et al. (2005) scanned the CAPN3 gene in 530 individuals with different grades of symptoms consistent with LGMD. They found 141 LGMD2A patients carrying 82 different CAPN3 mutations, of which 45 were novel. Females had a more favorable course than males. In 94% of the most severely affected LGMD2A patients, the defect was also discovered in the second allele. CAPN3 mutations were found in 35.1% of patients with classic LGMD phenotypes, 18.4% of atypical patients, and 12.6% of patients with high serum creatine kinase levels. Piluso et al. (2005) broadened the spectrum of LGMD2A phenotypes and set the carrier frequency at 1:103. ANIMAL MODEL Tagawa et al. (2000) created transgenic mice that expressed an inactive mutant of p94, in which the active site cys129 is replaced by ser (p94:C129S). Transgenic mice expressing p94:C129S mRNA showed significantly decreased grip strength. Sections of soleus and extensor digitorum longus (EDL) muscles of the aged transgenic mice showed increased numbers of lobulated and split fibers, respectively, which are often observed in limb girdle muscular dystrophy muscles. Centrally placed nuclei were also frequently found in the EDL muscle of the transgenic mice, whereas wildtype mice of the same age had almost none. There was more p94 protein produced in aged transgenic mice muscles, and it showed significantly less autolytic degradation activity than that of wildtype mice. The authors hypothesized that accumulation of p94:C129S protein caused these myopathy phenotypes.

comment: A number sign (#) is used with this entry because campomelic dysplasia can be caused by haploinsufficiency of the SOX9 gene (608160). DESCRIPTION Campomelic dysplasia is a disorder of the newborn characterized by congenital bowing and angulation of long bones, together with other skeletal and extraskeletal defects. Up to two-thirds of affected XY individuals have a gradation of genital defects or may develop as phenotypic females (Wagner et al., 1994). CLINICAL FEATURES Caffey (1947) reported a congenital syndrome with prenatal bowing and thickening of tubular bones with multiple cutaneous dimples in the arms and legs. Angle (1954) reported congenital bowing and angulation of the long bones. Weller (1959) noted that congenital bowing of the legs occurs in osteogenesis imperfecta congenita (OIC; 166210) and in hypophosphatasia with congenital dimples (241500). Cutaneous dimpling can occur with any prenatal bowing (see 264050). The designation campomelic (or camptomelic) dwarfism, proposed by Maroteaux et al. (1971), comes from the bowing of the legs, especially the tibias. The scapulas are very small and the pelvis and spine show changes. Eleven pairs of ribs are usually present. The inferior part of the scapula is hypoplastic. Cleft palate, micrognathia, flat face, and hypertelorism are also features. Most patients die in the neonatal period of respiratory distress. Disarray of the hair ('unruly' hair) is present in some patients. Severe anomalies of the lower cervical spine may lead to an appearance of pterygium colli. Pterygium syndrome was a referral diagnosis in at least 1 case. Stuve and Wiedemann (1971) observed 2 sisters with 'congenital bowing of the long bones.' Lee et al. (1972) described 3 cases emphasizing the tracheobronchial hypoplasia as a significant factor in the neonatal respiratory deaths. Parental consanguinity was noted by Cremin et al. (1973) in only 1 of 11 reported cases. Hovmoller et al. (1977) pointed out the association of sex reversal. In 9 previously reported cases the karyotype had been studied and in one of these cases a girl was found to have a 46,XY karyotype. Abnormal external genitalia were described in other cases. Hovmoller et al. (1977) described in detail 2 unrelated girls with XY karyotypes who died at ages 4 days and 11 months. Hoefnagel et al. (1978) described 2 female newborns with camptomelic dysplasia and XY gonadal dysgenesis. Hall and Spranger (1980) commented on the fact that some affected males have female external genitalia and vagina, uterus, and fallopian tubes. Dagna Bricarelli et al. (1981) described a family in which the brother of a typical case had features suggesting an abnormality but whose limbs showed very little bowing. Indeed, all the long bones of the arms and legs were slim and straight. Houston et al. (1983) reported 17 cases of the campomelic syndrome and a follow-up of one of the original patients (by then 17 years old) of Maroteaux et al. (1971). Their review was based on 97 patients, including their own. They emphasized the diagnostic value of the very small, bladeless scapulas and hypoplastic pedicles of thoracic vertebrae. The hips were usually dislocated and talipes equinovarus deformities were present. The chondrocranium was small and the neurocranium disproportionately large. Respiratory distress was caused by small thoracic cage, narrow airways from defective tracheobronchial cartilages, and sometimes micrognathia, cleft palate, retroglossia and hypoplastic lungs. Absence of the olfactory bulbs and tracts, and heart and renal malformations have been noted. Most patients died in early infancy. Their 17-year-old surviving patient had an estimated IQ of 45 and hearing loss. Houston et al. (1983) reported affected sibs. Other reports of affected sibs referenced by them include those of Shafai and Schwartz (1976), Mellows et al. (1980), Dagna Bricarelli et al. (1981), and Fryns et al. (1981). Moedjono et al. (1980) described concordantly affected monozygotic female twins. Two XY females reported by Dagna Bricarelli et al. (1981) were H-Y negative. Lynch et al. (1993) reported a mother and daughter with clinical and radiologic findings consistent with the diagnosis of campomelic dysplasia. They noted that the disorder had been thought to be autosomal recessive because of recurrence in sib pairs and also the presence of consanguinity in some families. Milder tibial bowing and significant shortening of the phalanges in both the hands and the feet were suggested as distinguishing features from the classic form of the disease. Lynch et al. (1993) pointed to the report by Thurmon et al. (1973) of campomelic dysplasia in half sibs, the mother of whom had mild tibial bowing. They suggested that this could be an example of autosomal dominant inheritance with reduced penetrance or maternal gonadal mosaicism. Mansour et al. (1995) collected information on 36 patients with campomelic dysplasia from genetic centers, radiologists, and pathologists in the United Kingdom. The chromosomal sex ratio was approximately 1:1. There was a predominance of phenotypic females owing to sex reversal. Sex reversal or ambiguous genitalia was found in three-quarters of the chromosomal males. Three patients were still alive, 2 with chromosomal rearrangements involving 17q. Most of the patients died in the neonatal period. The 36 index cases had 41 sibs of whom only 2 were affected. Formal segregation analysis gave a segregation ratio of 0.05; 95% CI = approximately 0.00 to 0.11. This was considered to exclude autosomal recessive inheritance and to suggest that this disorder is a sporadic, autosomal dominant. Patients with a chromosomal rearrangement involving 17q23.3-q25.1 showed a milder phenotype. As in the case of other neonatal lethal autosomal dominant disorders that have been thought to be autosomal recessive (e.g., osteogenesis imperfecta congenita), parents of infants with campomelic dysplasia had probably often been dissuaded from having further children. Mansour et al. (1995) provided diagnostic criteria. Mansour et al. (2002) described 5 patients with campomelic dysplasia who had survived to ages ranging from 7 to 20 years. All 5 had characteristic facial features, including flat face, hypertelorism, long philtrum, depressed nasal bridge, micrognathia, and relative macrocephaly. Complications included conductive hearing loss, developmental delay, kyphoscoliosis, and other orthopedic problems. The authors commented that surviving campomelic dysplasia is a recognizable entity. Velagaleti et al. (2005) summarized the clinical features of campomelic dysplasia, noting the characteristic presence of skeletal anomalies such as bowed femurs and tibiae, hypoplastic scapulae, 11 pairs of ribs, pelvic malformations, Pierre Robin sequence, and clubbed feet. In two-thirds of affected individuals with a 46,XY karyotype, male-to-female sex reversal had been described. Watiker et al. (2005) reported 2 patients originally diagnosed as having Cumming syndrome (211890) who were subsequently found to have mutations in the SOX9 gene, prompting reassessment of the cases and reclassification as campomelic dysplasia. Features consistent with Cumming syndrome included campomelia of prenatal onset, cystic hygroma, and a small chest; 1 patient also had a cleft palate and multicystic kidneys, and the other had a complex congenital heart defect. The patients also had short, irregular chondrocyte columns, whereas chondroosseous morphology appears normal in campomelic dysplasia except at the diaphyseal bend. Watiker et al. (2005) concluded that the presence of a narrow, tall pelvis, hypoplastic scapulae, and sex reversal are key findings in campomelic dysplasia that allow it to be differentiated from Cumming syndrome. - Acampomelic Dysplasia Although campomelia is one of the most common clinical features of this disorder and the feature that gives it its name, cases without campomelia (acampomelic CMPD) have been reported (Macpherson et al., 1989; Friedrich et al., 1992). In angiographic studies in 4 patients with the campomelic syndrome, Rodriguez (1993) found striking abnormalities, particularly absence or marked deficiency of the anterior tibial artery. One of the 4, a phenotypic female with a 46,XY karyotype, lacked lower limb bowing and the talipes equinovarus typical of campomelic syndrome. This infant was thought to constitute a further example of campomelic syndrome without campomelia. In this case the other features of the syndrome were present: ovarian dysgenesis, craniofacial changes, and defective tracheal bronchial cartilage resulting in respiratory distress and death. The patient had a normal arterial pattern in the legs. Rodriguez (1993) thus concluded that there was a developmental association between vascular defects and lower limb anomalies in this disorder. The aberrant arterial pattern may affect muscle development. The shortness of the posterior femoral and calf muscles in turn fix the knee and the ankle joints, and bone bowing may be related to the abnormal mechanical forces applied to the developing long bones of the lower limb. Glass and Rosenbaum (1997) presented 2 sisters with acampomelic CMPD between whom there were some clinical and radiographic differences and also variations from classic campomelic dysplasia. They described shallow orbits, a radiographic finding that had not previously been described in this dysplasia. Ozkilic et al. (2002) noted 9 reported cases of acampomelic dysplasia and added another case. CYTOGENETICS Cooke et al. (1985) described a typical case of campomelic dysplasia with sex reversal in a single family with a balanced t(5;8)(q33.1;q21.4) in 4 generations. The child had inherited the translocation from the father. The infant had female external genitalia and XY sex chromosome constitution. Primary follicles, each with a central ovum, were demonstrated in the dysgenetic gonads. The uterus and both fallopian tubes were morphologically normal. Maraia et al. (1991) observed a de novo paracentric inversion of 17q in an infant with campomelic dysplasia, and they postulated involvement of the COL1A1 gene (120150) or the HOX2 gene (142960). Young et al. (1992) described a typical case of campomelic dysplasia in a phenotypically female fetus with a de novo reciprocal translocation, 46,XY,t(2;17)(q35;q23-24). In light of the report also by Maraia et al. (1991) of a rearrangement involving the long arm of chromosome 17 in association with campomelic dysplasia, they considered it likely that a gene for this disorder lies on 17q. Tommerup et al. (1993) indicated that there are 5 known cases of campomelic dysplasia with a break in 17q25, either de novo or cosegregating. They proposed that 17q24.3-q25.1 is the site of an autosomal sex-reversal gene, which they called SRA1, that is mutated in CMPD. Ninomiya et al. (1996) investigated a patient in whom acampomelic CMPD and sex reversal were associated with a de novo t(12;17) translocation. The breakpoint on 17q was located in the same region as that observed in translocation patients reported by others. Patients with acampomelic campomelic dysplasia have no long bone curvature. Affected children have a characteristically flat facial profile and present with respiratory distress. They all have markedly hypoplastic scapulas. Savarirayan and Bankier (1998) described a child with a severe form of acampomelic dysplasia who had a de novo reciprocal translocation, 46,XX,t(5;17)(q15;q25.1). The child died at 11 days of age due to respiratory complications. Savarirayan and Bankier (1998) noted the similarity between their case and that reported by Maraia et al. (1991). The authors also noted that, contrary to previous reports, this child with acampomelic dysplasia associated with chromosome rearrangements was severely affected. Pfeifer et al. (1999) presented 3 novel cases of CMPD associated with translocations and summarized features of the 11 translocation cases reported to that time, bringing the total to 14 cases. They noted the tendency of translocation patients to have a longer life expectancy than patients with mutations in the SOX9 coding region. They also noted that, whereas only 1 of 22 reported patients with SOX9 mutations had acampomelia, 7 of 14 translocation patients showed acampomelia or only mild bowing of the limbs. See 602196 for a disorder related to CMPD associated with translocation upstream of the SOX9 gene. MOLECULAR GENETICS In 6 of 9 patients with campomelic dysplasia, Foster et al. (1994) identified mutations in single alleles of the SOX9 gene (e.g., 608160.0001). Both parents of 2 of the patients did not have the mutation. The de novo appearance of a mutation in a sex-reversed campomelic patient established that alterations in SOX9 caused both abnormalities. The findings in this case suggested to Foster et al. (1994) that campomelic dysplasia is an autosomal dominant disorder. They did not detect mutations in both SOX9 alleles of any patient. Dominance appeared to be due to haploinsufficiency rather than gain of function. Wagner et al. (1994) likewise identified inactivating mutations in 1 SOX9 allele in nontranslocation CMPD-SOX9 cases, pointing to haploinsufficiency for SOX9 as the cause of both campomelic dysplasia and autosomal XY sex reversal (see 608160.0005). Cameron and Sinclair (1997) stated that 14 heterozygous mutations in SOX9 and 10 translocations involving 17q have been described in 28 patients with campomelic dysplasia. There had been no reported cases of patients having both a balanced 17q translocation and a mutation in SOX9. Ten of the 14 SOX9 mutations were associated with 46,XY sex reversal. Olney et al. (1999) described a patient with campomelic dysplasia and complete deletion of 1 SOX9 gene. This was thought to represent the strongest evidence to date for dosage-dependent action of the SOX9 protein in normal chondrogenesis. GENOTYPE/PHENOTYPE CORRELATIONS Meyer et al. (1997) succeeded in identifying the causative mutation in 11 of 12 patients with campomelic dysplasia: 10 novel mutations and 1 previously reported mutation (Y440X; 608160.0005). When tested in cell transfection experiments, the recurrent nonsense mutation Y440X, found in 2 patients who survived for 4 and more than 9 years, respectively, exhibited some residual transactivation ability. In contrast, a frameshift mutation extending the protein by 70 residues at codon 507, found in a patient who died shortly after birth, showed no transactivation. This was apparently due to instability of the mutant SOX9 protein as demonstrated by Western blotting. Amino acid substitutions and nonsense mutations were found in patients with and without XY sex reversal, indicating that sex reversal in this disorder is subject to variable penetrance. Meyer et al. (1997) also studied 18 female patients with XY gonadal dysgenesis, or Swyer syndrome (233420, 306100) and found no altered SOX9 banding pattern by SSCP in any, providing evidence that SOX9 mutations do not usually result in XY sex reversal without skeletal malformations. Meyer et al. (1997) stated that before their publication a total of 13 SOX9 mutations had been published as causes of CMD. In a female infant with campomelic dysplasia and XY sex reversal who died of respiratory failure at 3 months of age, Pop et al. (2005) identified homozygosity for the Y440X mutation in the SOX9 gene, which arose by a mitotic gene conversion event between a de novo mutant maternal allele and a wildtype paternal allele. Transient cotransfection experiments in mouse neuro2a cells demonstrated that the Y440X mutant retained some transactivation capacity on authentic SOX9-responsive promoters/enhancers, ranging from 5 to 22% of wildtype activity. Pop et al. (2005) suggested that this is a hypomorphic rather than a complete loss-of-function allele, which may account for the milder phenotype and longer survival seen in some patients with this mutation. ANIMAL MODEL Bi et al. (2001) generated heterozygous Sox9 mutant mice that reproduced most of the skeletal abnormalities of campomelic dysplasia. The heterozygous Sox9 mice died perinatally with cleft palate, as well as hypoplasia and bending of many skeletal structures derived from cartilage precursors. In embryonic day (E) 14.5 embryos, bending of radius, ulna, and tibia cartilages was already prominent. In E12.5 embryos, all skeletal elements visualized by Alcian blue staining were smaller. In addition, the overall levels of type II collagen RNA at E10.5 and E12.5 were lower than in wildtype embryos. Bi et al. (2001) proposed that the skeletal abnormalities observed at later embryonic stages were caused by delayed or defective precartilaginous condensations. Furthermore, in E18.5 embryos and in newborns, premature mineralization occurred in many bones, including vertebrae and some craniofacial bones. Because Sox9 is not expressed in the mineralized portion of the growth plate, this premature mineralization is very likely the consequence of allele insufficiency existing in cells of the growth plate that express Sox9. Because the hypertrophic zone of the heterozygous Sox9 mutants was larger than that of wildtype mice, Bi et al. (2001) proposed that Sox9 also has a role in regulating the transition to hypertrophic chondrocytes in the growth plate. Despite the severe hypoplasia of cartilages, the overall organization and cellular composition of the growth plate were otherwise normal. The results suggested that 2 critical steps of the chondrocyte differentiation pathway are sensitive to Sox9 dosage: an early step presumably at the stage of mesenchymal condensation of cartilage primordia, and a later step preceding the transition of chondrocytes into hypertrophic chondrocytes. HISTORY Studying DNA from 5 cases, Ebensperger et al. (1991) could find no evidence of mutation in the SRY, ZFY (490000), ZFX (314980), or MEA (143170) genes. In addition to Southern analysis, gene expression of ZFY, ZFX, and MEA was found to be normal.

comment: A number sign (#) is used with this entry because one form of dilated cardiomyopathy can be caused by mutation in the lamin A/C gene (LMNA; 150330) on chromosome 1q21. Allelic disorders include the autosomal dominant form of Emery-Dreifuss muscular dystrophy (181350), and Hutchinson-Gilford progeria syndrome (176670), among others. Mutations in several other genes have been found to cause different forms of dilated cardiomyopathy. These include CMD1D (601494), caused by mutation in the TNNT2 gene (191045) on 1q32; CMD1E (601154), caused by mutation in the SCN5A gene (600153) on 3p; CMD1G (604145), caused by mutation in the TTN gene (188840) on 2q31; CMD1I (604765), caused by mutation in the DES gene (125660) on 2q35; CMD1J (605362), caused by mutation in the EYA4 gene (603550) on 6q23-q24; CMD1L (606685), caused by mutation in the SGCD gene (601411) on 5q33; CMD1M (607482), caused by mutation in the CSRP3 gene (600824) on 11p15.1; CMD1N (607487), caused by mutation in the TCAP gene (604488) on 17q12; CMD1O (608569), caused by mutation in the ABCC9 gene (601439) on 12p12.1; CMD1P (609909), caused by mutation in the PLN gene (172405) on 6q22.1; CMD1R, caused by mutation in the ACTC gene (102540) on 15q14; and CMD1S, caused by mutation in the MYH7 gene (160760) on 14q12. Mutation in the MYBPC3 gene (see 600958.0013) is a possible cause of CMD. In some families and isolated patients with dilated cardiomyopathy (see CMD1C; 601493) with or without noncompaction of the left ventricle, mutations have been identified in the LDB3 gene (605906), which maps to 10q22.2-q23. Several additional loci for familial dilated cardiomyopathy have been mapped: CMD1B (600884) on 9q13; CMD1F (602067) on 6q23; CMD1H (604288) on 2q14-q22; CMD1K (605582) on 6q12-q16; and CMD1Q (609915) on 7q22.3-q31.1. CLINICAL FEATURES Dilated cardiomyopathy, a disorder characterized by cardiac dilation and reduced systolic function, represents an outcome of a heterogeneous group of inherited and acquired disorders. Olson and Keating (1996) noted that causes include myocarditis, coronary artery disease, systemic diseases, and myocardial toxins; idiopathic dilated cardiomyopathy in which these causes are excluded represents approximately one-half of all cases. Idiopathic dilated cardiomyopathy occurs with a prevalence of about 36.5 per 100,000; it accounts for more than 10,000 deaths in the U.S. annually and is the primary indication for cardiac transplantation. Among cases of idiopathic dilated cardiomyopathy, familial occurrence accounts for 20 to 25%, with the exception of rare cases resulting from mutations in dystrophin (e.g., 300377.0021). Familial dilated cardiomyopathy is characterized by an autosomal dominant pattern of inheritance with age-related penetrance. It presents with development of ventricular dilatation and systolic dysfunction usually in the second or third decade of life. Whitfield (1961) described a family in which 10 members were suffering or had died from cardiomyopathy and 6 others were probably affected. Although both males and females were affected, transmission seemingly occurred only through the female. Schrader et al. (1961) described 2 sisters with familial idiopathic cardiomegaly. Almost certainly the mother, who died at age 34, and probably 1 brother, who died at age 16, had the same condition. In the family reported by Battersby and Glenner (1961), affected persons were limited to 1 sibship and deposits of a nonmetachromatic, diastase-resistant, PAS-positive polysaccharide were described in the myocardium. Undoubtedly heterogeneity exists in the group of cardiomyopathies. Boyd et al. (1965) suggested that there may be 3 forms: (1) a form with predominant fibrosis, (2) a form with predominant hypertrophy (see ventricular hypertrophy, hereditary; 192600), and (3) a form with deposits described above. See amyloidosis III (176300.0007) for another familial cardiomyopathy. Kariv et al. (1966) observed 6 affected persons in 3 generations. In 2 of these persons, Adams-Stokes attacks required an artificial pacemaker. The affected males showed significant increase in the serum levels of multiple muscle-derived enzymes. Heterogeneity was suggested by the finding of normal serum enzyme levels in affected members of a second family. Rywlin et al. (1969) favored the view that obstructive and nonobstructive forms of familial cardiopathy are different expressions of a single entity. Classification into 'hypertrophic' and 'congestive' clinical types by Goodwin (1970) implies the same. Sommer et al. (1972) took an opposite view, i.e., that there is a separate nonobstructive familial cardiomyopathy. They described an Amish family with affected persons in 3 generations. Severity varied widely. The most severely affected pursued a rapidly fatal course whereas others manifested mainly conduction defects compatible with long survival. Machida et al. (1971) described a Japanese family with affected persons in 2 and perhaps 3 generations with male-to-male transmission. Emanuel et al. (1971) suggested that both dominant and recessive forms may exist. The possibility of an autosomal recessive form of congestive cardiomyopathy was raised by Yamaguchi et al. (1977), who found an astoundingly high rate of parental consanguinity (about 64%) and a segregation ratio of 0.196 consistent with autosomal recessive inheritance. Moller et al. (1979) described an autosomal dominant form of congestive cardiomyopathy. The earliest sign of the disease was arrhythmia and/or conduction defects. Symptoms of pump failure had their onset in adulthood. Three members of the extensively affected kindred had died suddenly. Septal hypertrophy was found in 2 affected persons. Fragola et al. (1988) studied 44 first-degree relatives of 12 probands with idiopathic dilated cardiomyopathy. Affected relatives were identified in 4 of 12 families. In each case, the affected relatives were sibs. This may be due to a late age of onset for expression of genetic factors involved in the etiology of this condition. O'Connell et al. (1984) used endomyocardial biopsy and gallium-67 scans in patients with dilated cardiomyopathy to demonstrate a subset of patients with myocardial inflammation. Histologic confirmation was found at autopsy. A defect in suppressor lymphocyte function was found in 1 patient, who showed improvement with immunosuppressive therapy. In 1 family, 5 persons in 3 generations were affected; in another, a father and 2 brothers were affected. Battersby and Glenner (1961) reported striking pericardial effusion in a family with cardiomyopathy. Other early reports (e.g., Evans, 1949) have commented on inflammatory changes found at necropsy. Pericardial effusion occurs episodically with the iron-overload cardiomyopathy of multitransfused thalassemia and occurs also in the cardiomyopathy of Friedreich ataxia (229300). Ozick et al. (1984) reported identical twin sisters with congestive cardiomyopathy and autoimmune thyroid disease. Both had antithyroid microsomal antibodies and cytolytic antiheart myolemmal antibodies. The postpartum state may have been a factor in one of the twins; both cardiomyopathy and autoimmune thyroid disease may become clinically apparent in the postpartum period. Gardner et al. (1985) evaluated a kindred in which 12 persons had cardiomegaly with poor ventricular function and/or dysrhythmia. The disorder was evident by echocardiogram in a 6-month-old infant. Skeletal muscle biopsies showed subtle myopathic alterations. The pedigree, spanning 5 generations, was consistent with autosomal dominant inheritance. Gardner et al. (1987) described a family in which multiple members in 3 and probably 4 generations had dilated cardiomyopathy with overt clinical onset between the fourth and seventh decades. Dysrhythmia was frequent. They concluded that there might be an associated skeletal myopathy manifested by very mild proximal weakness or detectable only on biopsy. MacLennan et al. (1987) described 8 affected individuals, 4 of whom were males in 3 generations. Average age at presentation was 39.5 years. Average time to death from onset of symptoms suggestive of cardiomyopathy in 6 affected members was 16 months. One member died suddenly after being asymptomatic. The myocardium showed variation in muscle fiber size and interstitial fibrosis. Graber et al. (1986) described a large kindred with an autosomal dominant form of disease of the cardiac conduction system and of the myocardium. Stage I occurred in the second and third decades and was characterized by absence of symptoms, normal heart size, sinus bradycardia, and premature atrial contractions. Stage II was marked by first-degree AV block in the third and fourth decades. Stage III occurred in the fourth and fifth decades and was accompanied by chest pain, fatigue, lightheadedness, and advanced AV block, followed by the development of atrial fibrillation or flutter. Stage IV, in the fifth and sixth decades of life, was characterized by congestive heart failure and recurrent ventricular arrhythmias. Right ventricular endomyocardial biopsy specimens showed progressive changes. At autopsy in the proband, the atrial changes were more severe than the ventricular ones. This suggested that the disorder discussed in entry 108770 is the same as this condition. While there was a range in the phenotypic expression of the inherited gene defect in this kindred, the dilated cardiomyopathy was less impressive than the dysrhythmia. Arrhythmias were the earliest manifestation of the disease (in the second to third decade). Schmidt et al. (1988) studied familial dilated cardiomyopathy in 6 families. The familial nature of the disorder was not readily apparent in 3 of these families until thorough family investigations were performed. The authors suggested that the family history should be reviewed in all patients with dilated cardiomyopathy and that further investigation of relatives should be performed if there are cases of unexplained heart disease, sudden unexpected death, or syncopal episodes. Echocardiography is a convenient noninvasive tool for these investigations. Early diagnosis is indicated for 2 reasons: treatment of significant arrhythmias may prevent sudden unexpected death, and genetic counseling can be provided. In studies of the first-degree relatives of 59 index cases with idiopathic dilated cardiomyopathy, Michels et al. (1992) found that 18 relatives from 12 families had dilated cardiomyopathy. Thus, 12 of the 59 index patients (20.3%) had familial disease. No differences in age, sex, severity of disease, exposure to selected environmental factors, or electrocardiographic or echocardiographic features were detected between the index patients with familial disease and those with nonfamilial disease. A noteworthy finding was that 22 of 240 healthy relatives (9.2%) with normal ejection fractions had increased left ventricular diameters during systole or diastole (or both), as compared with 2 of 112 healthy control subjects (1.8%) who were studied separately. In a case-control study of idiopathic dilated cardiomyopathy in Baltimore, a roughly 3-fold increase in risk was observed among blacks after adjustment for potential confounding variables (Coughlin et al., 1990). The increased frequency of dilated cardiomyopathy in black males was the basis in the past of the designation 'Osler-2 myocarditis'; Osler-2 was the black male ward at The Johns Hopkins Hospital. Michels et al. (1993) performed PCR-based assays and Southern blot analysis of the dystrophin gene (DMD; 300377) in 27 males with idiopathic dilated cardiomyopathy. Five families had familial disease, without male-to-male transmission in 4 families. In the fifth family, there was no evidence of male-to-male transmission when the family was entered into the study, but on follow-up the index patient's son was found to have developed the disease. None of the patients had clinical evidence of skeletal muscle disease or any systemic illness that could cause heart disease. The mean age of the patients was 50.2 years; the range of age was 5 to 72 years. No dystrophin gene defects were found. Csanady et al. (1995) compared 31 familial and 209 nonfamilial cases of dilated cardiomyopathy. They concluded that the familial form is more malignant: it occurs at an earlier age and progresses more rapidly than the nonfamilial form. For a review of the genetic and clinical heterogeneity of familial dilated cardiomyopathy, see Seidman and Seidman (2001). CLINICAL MANAGEMENT Meune et al. (2006) investigated the efficacy of implantable cardioverter-defibrillators (ICDs) in the primary prevention of sudden death in patients with cardiomyopathy due to lamin A/C gene mutations. Patients referred for permanent cardiac pacing were systematically offered the implantation of an ICD. The patients were enrolled solely on the basis of the presence of lamin A/C mutations associated with cardiac conduction defects. Indications for pacemaker implantation were progressive conduction block and sinus block. In all, 19 patients were treated. Meune et al. (2006) concluded that ICD implantation in patients with lamin A/C mutations who are in need of a pacemaker is effective in treating possibly lethal tachyarrhythmias, and that implantation of an ICD, rather than a pacemaker, should be considered for such patients. MAPPING Koike et al. (1987) described 2 families with dilated cardiomyopathy. In 1 of these families, the mode of inheritance was autosomal dominant; in the other, it appeared to be autosomal recessive. In both families, the pattern of inheritance was consistent with linkage to the HLA locus; however, because the families were small, the lod scores were low. From linkage studies in 12 families, Olson et al. (1995) excluded genetic linkage between the disease phenotype and a 21-cM region spanning the HLA cluster in at least 60% of the families. By linkage studies, Kass et al. (1994) demonstrated linkage of the disease locus to polymorphic loci near the centromere of chromosome 1; maximum multipoint lod score = 13.2 in the interval between D1S305 and D1S176. Based on the disease phenotype and the map location, Kass et al. (1994) speculated that the gap junction protein connexin 40 (121013) is a candidate for the site of mutations that result in conduction system disease and dilated cardiomyopathy. Csanady et al. (1995) compared 31 familial and 209 nonfamilial cases of dilated cardiomyopathy. They concluded that the familial form is more malignant: it occurs at an earlier age and progresses more rapidly than the nonfamilial form. Among 100 patients with dilated cardiomyopathy, McKenna et al. (1997) found that familial prevalence was definite in 14 of 56 (25%) and possible in 25 of 56 (45%). The HLA-DR4 frequency in the 100 patients with dilated cardiomyopathy was similar to that in 9,000 controls; however, the DR4 subtype was significantly more common in the 25 probands with a familial tendency to dilated cardiomyopathy than in the 31 probands with nonfamilial dilated cardiomyopathy. McKenna et al. (1997) concluded that there is an HLA-linked predisposition to familial dilated cardiomyopathy. MOLECULAR GENETICS In 5 of 11 families with autosomal dominant dilated cardiomyopathy and conduction system defects, Fatkin et al. (1999) identified 5 heterozygous missense mutations in the LMNA gene (150330.0005-150330.0009). Each mutation caused heritable, progressive conduction system disease (sinus bradycardia, atrioventricular conduction block, or atrial arrhythmias) and dilated cardiomyopathy. Heart failure and sudden death occurred frequently within these families. No family members with mutations had either joint contractures or skeletal myopathy. Furthermore, serum creatine kinase levels were normal in family members with mutations in the lamin rod domain, but mildly elevated in some family members with a defect in the tail domain of lamin C. The findings indicated that the lamin A/C intermediate filament protein plays an important role in cardiac conduction and contractility. In an editorial accompanying the report of Fatkin et al. (1999), Graham and Owens (1999) tabulated the chromosomal locations of the known loci responsible for inherited forms of dilated cardiomyopathy. Brodsky et al. (2000) presented a large family with a severe autosomal dominant dilated cardiomyopathy with an atrioventricular conduction defect in some affected members. In addition, some affected individuals had skeletal muscle symptoms varying from minimal weakness to a mild limb-girdle muscular dystrophy. One individual had a pattern of skeletal muscle involvement that the authors considered consistent with mild Emery-Dreifuss muscular dystrophy. Affected individuals were heterozygous for a single nucleotide deletion in the lamin A/C gene (150330.0013). The authors highlighted the wide range in phenotype arising from this mutation. In 2 families with dilated cardiomyopathy with conduction defects, Sebillon et al. (2003) identified 2 different mutations in the LMNA gene (150330.0028, 150330.0029). In 1 family, the phenotype was characterized by early-onset atrial fibrillation preceding or coexisting with dilated cardiomyopathy. Kamisago et al. (2000) performed clinical evaluations in 21 kindreds with familial dilated cardiomyopathy. In a genomewide linkage study, a genetic locus for mutations associated with dilated cardiomyopathy was identified at chromosome 14q11.2-q13 (maximum lod score = 5.11 at theta = 0.0), where the gene for cardiac beta-myosin heavy chain (MYH7; 160760) is located. Analyses of this and other genes for sarcomere proteins identified disease-causing dominant mutations in 4 kindreds; 2 missense mutations in MYH7 (ser532 to pro; 160760.0022 and phe764 to leu; 160760.0023) and a deletion in cardiac troponin T (TNNT2; 191045) caused early-onset ventricular dilatation (average age at diagnosis, 24 years) and diminished contractile function and frequently resulted in heart failure. Affected persons had neither antecedent cardiac hypertrophy nor histopathologic findings characteristic of hypertrophy. Schmitt et al. (2003) sequenced the phospholamban (PLN; 172405) gene in 20 unrelated individuals with inherited dilated cardiomyopathy and heart failure. In 1, an arginine-to-cysteine substitution at codon 9 (172405.0001) segregated with disease in a 4-generation family with autosomal dominant dilated cardiomyopathy with progression to heart failure within 5 to 10 years after symptom onset in the third decade. The average age at death of affected individuals was 25.1 +/- 12.7 years. In 2 unrelated families with idiopathic dilated cardiomyopathy, Haghighi et al. (2003) identified a truncating mutation of the PLN gene, leu39 to ter (L39X; 172405.0002). The 2 homozygous individuals developed dilated cardiomyopathy and heart failure requiring cardiac transplantation at ages 16 and 27 years, respectively; 11 heterozygous individuals exhibited variable clinical findings indicating incomplete penetrance of the cardiomyopathy phenotype: 2 had dilated cardiomyopathy with ejection fractions of 25% or less, 4 had left ventricular hypertrophy with normal left ventricular systolic function, and 5 had normal echocardiograms. ANIMAL MODEL Elliott et al. (2003) generated HLA-DQ8 transgenic AI-beta knockout NOD mice that did not show insulitis or diabetes but developed dilated cardiomyopathy. The constellation of findings of spontaneously arising destructive focal lymphocytic infiltrates within the myocardium, rising titers of circulating anticardiac autoantibodies, dilation of the cardiac chambers, and gradual progression to end-stage heart failure bore a striking resemblance to clinical features in humans with idiopathic dilated cardiomyopathy. Elliott et al. (2003) concluded that this transgenic strain provides a highly relevant animal model for human autoimmune myocarditis and postinflammatory dilated cardiomyopathy.

comment: A number sign (#) is used with this entry because ocular coloboma can be caused by mutations in the sonic hedgehog gene (SHH; 600725) and in the PAX6 gene (607108). CLINICAL FEATURES Typical isolated ocular coloboma is a congenital abnormality caused by defective closure of the embryonic fissure of the optic cup. The defect is typically located in the lower part of the iris. Gregory-Evans et al. (2004) provided a detailed review of the molecular genetics of ocular coloboma, including a list of inherited disorders and syndromes in which coloboma is a feature. Barros-Nunez et al. (1995) described a 6-year-old boy in whom bilateral iris coloboma had been observed at birth. Psychomotor development was normal. He showed a typical inferonasal bilateral coloboma of the iris and ciliary body without coloboma of the choroid and retina or optic nerve. Retina, lens, corneal diameters, and visual acuity were normal in both eyes and there were no malformations elsewhere. A male and female first cousin of the proband related through their fathers had iris coloboma and the son of a sister of the father of the proband had unilateral coloboma. The parents in the case of all 3 sibships were normal as were the grandparents. Some unusual molecular mechanism, such as trinucleotide expansion, was suggested, giving the picture of 'delayed mutation' or 'premutation.' Hornby et al. (2000) correlated visual function with clinical features and biometric findings in the eyes of children with coloboma. Of the 196 eyes with colobomatous malformations, 11 had microphthalmos with cyst (251505), and 185 eyes had coloboma (associated with microcornea in 155 eyes and with normal corneal diameter in 30 eyes). The visual prognosis depended on the phenotype of the more normal eye. Microphthalmos with cyst had the worst prognosis (all worse than 20/400). Microcornea with microphthalmos had a worse prognosis than microcornea without microphthalmos. For microcornea with microphthalmos, 67% saw worse than 20/400. Of the children with microcornea without microphthalmos, 76% saw better than 20/400. Simple coloboma (without microcornea or microphthalmos) had the best visual prognosis: only 7% saw 20/400 or worse. A corneal diameter of less than 6 mm had a poor visual prognosis, whereas a corneal diameter of more than 10 mm had a good prognosis. Morrison et al. (2000) examined 75 children with iris colobomas. In 13 (17.3%) patients, noticeable iris heterochromia (142500) was present. In patients with unilateral coloboma, the heterochromia was characterized by the darker iris being the one affected with coloboma. In cases of bilateral iris colobomas with clinical microphthalmos and reduced corneal diameter, the variation in iris color was inconsistent. A fundus coloboma was not always present. The authors postulated that the iris coloboma-iris heterochromia association may result from the abnormal closure of the embryonic fissure, resulting in irregular or excessive migration of neural crest cells into the iris stroma. In addition, the high frequency of iris heterochromia-iris coloboma with microphthalmia suggests that an increased density of pigmented cells within the iris stroma may be a contributing factor. Pigment-dispersion syndrome (600510) and pigmentary glaucoma result from iridozonular friction causing disruption of the iris epithelium and deposition of iris pigment on the anterior segment structures. Tesser (2003) reported a 48-year-old patient with congenital bilateral iris colobomas. Elevated intraocular pressure was present in the eye with a partial iris coloboma and iris transillumination defects but pigment deposition on the ipsilateral corneal endothelium (Krukenberg spindle). The other eye was diagnosed as having mild ocular hypertension, without pigment dispersion or glaucoma, in association with a complete iris coloboma. Tesser (2003) concluded that pigment dispersion was prevented in the eye with the complete iris coloboma. Iris colobomas occur as part of complex malformation syndromes, e.g., iris coloboma with ptosis, hypertelorism, and mental retardation (243310), craniofacial dysmorphism with ocular coloboma, absent corpus callosum, and aortic dilatation (218340), and Hirschsprung disease, microcephaly, and iris coloboma (235730). Yuksel et al. (1999) described 2 female sibs with an MCA/MR syndrome consisting of pre- and postnatal growth retardation, iris colobomata, spasticity, facial dysmorphism, and dilated cerebral ventricles. Coloboma is a prime feature of the CHARGE association (see 214800). INHERITANCE Pedigrees supporting dominant inheritance have been reported. Eldridge (1967) observed an affected family with a dominant pedigree pattern. Snell (1908) observed 12 cases in 5 generations. Pagon et al. (1981) suggested autosomal recessive inheritance (see 216820). POPULATION GENETICS The estimated prevalence of coloboma is 1 in 10,000 (Stoll et al., 1997). CYTOGENETICS Arias et al. (1984) studied a patient with de novo deletion of 2p25.1-pter. ACP1 (171500) and MDH1 (154200) levels were normal, suggesting that these loci are proximal to 2p25.1. The child had bilateral coloboma of the iris. MOLECULAR GENETICS In a family segregating nonsyndromic ocular colobomas, Schimmenti et al. (2003) found that affected members has a 24-bp deletion in the SHH gene (600725.0001), which maps to chromosome 7q26. Azuma et al. (2003) identified a mutation in the PAX6 gene (607108.0019) in a 1-year-old boy who had iris anomaly, large coloboma of the optic nerve (120430), retina, and choroid, a remnant of hyaloid vessel proliferation (persistent hyperplastic primary vitreous) bilaterally, and growth and mental retardation.

comment: D-amino acid oxidase (EC 1.4.3.3), one of the principal and characteristic flavoenzymes of peroxisomes, is found in the liver, kidney and brain of many mammalian species. It acts on a wide range of D-amino acids, but is inactive on the naturally occurring L-amino acids. Barker and Hopkinson (1977) showed that it is determined by a gene locus separate from that which determines D-aspartate oxidase (124450). The latter enzyme is active against the D but not the L form. Both enzymes are flavoproteins with flavin adenine dinucleotide (FAD) as the prosthetic group. Barker and Hopkinson (1977) found neither polymorphism nor rare genetic variants of this enzyme, which they abbreviated DAMOX. The biologic role of DAMOX and DASOX has been thought to be protection against L-amino acids of fungi, bacteria and insects, or contribution to acid-base balance in the kidney. Alternatively, they may be merely fossil enzymes, i.e., relics of our evolutionary past. Fukui and Miyake (1992) isolated genomic clones for the entire gene from human placental genomic libraries, with the aid of a previously cloned cDNA with human DAO as a probe. Nucleotide sequencing demonstrated that the gene, present as a single copy, comprises 11 exons and spans 20 kb. With the use of genomic DNAs prepared from human/Chinese hamster somatic hybrid cells as templates for PCR, Fukui and Miyake (1992) localized the DAMOX gene to human chromosome 12. Spinocerebellar ataxia-2 (SCA2; 183090) maps to 12q24 in a founder collective in Holguin, Cuba, with more than 500 patients with SCA2. Gispert et al. (1995) reported that complete allelic association was established with the microsatellite marker D12S105. The D12S105 sequence, including 342 basepairs representing the region of maximal allelic association in the Cuban SCA2 founder effect, was subjected to sequence homology analysis at the European Molecular Biology Laboratories database and yielded an almost perfect match (99.7% similarity) with intron 1 of the human D-amino acid oxidase gene (which had previously been shown to be linked to all SCA2 pedigrees worldwide with no recombination; Hernandez et al., 1995.) The small sequence differences were the result of length variations in the 4 primitive repeat motifs contained in this intron. The authors stated that a mutation in the DAO gene could fit well with previous hypotheses on the pathologic mechanism of spinocerebellar degeneration, since oral loading tests with glutamate in such patients have demonstrated a decreased metabolism of glutamic acid and aspartic acid, and since accumulation of the excitotoxic neurotransmitter glutamate is known to lead to cerebellar Purkinje neuron death. However, Gispert et al. (1995) found recombinants between SCA2 and a second microsatellite marker within intron 1 of the DAO gene. These and other recombination data of Gispert et al. (1995) excluded the DAMOX gene from the SCA2 region. DAAO is expressed in human brain, where it oxidizes D-serine, a potent activator of N-methyl-D-aspartate-type glutamate receptor (see 602717). Using yeast 2-hybrid analysis, Chumakov et al. (2002) identified DAAO as an interacting partner of the G72 protein (607408). The interaction between G72 and DAAO was confirmed in vitro and shown to result in activation of DAAO. Chumakov et al. (2002) found 4 single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) markers from DAAO that were associated with schizophrenia (181500) in the same Canadian case/control samples that led to the identification of G72. Logistic regression revealed genetic interaction between associated SNPs in the vicinity of 2 genes. Chumakov et al. (2002) concluded that association of both DAAO and G72 with schizophrenia, together with activation of DAAO by a G72 protein product, pointed to the involvement of this N-methyl-D-aspartate receptor regulation pathway in schizophrenia.

comment: D-aspartate oxidase (DDO; EC 1.4.3.1) is a flavoprotein that catalyzes the oxidative deamination of dicarboxylic D-amino acids to give the corresponding alpha-keto acids and ammonia. DDO is inactive with D-amino acids that are oxidized by D-amino acid oxidase (124050), which catalyzes the same reaction with neutral and basic D-amino acids as substrates. Simonic et al. (1997) cloned a full-length cDNA encoding the 341-amino acid bovine DDO protein. They detected weak expression in bovine kidney. Setoyama and Miura (1997) found sequences in the GenBank EST database that appeared to be transcripts of human D-aspartate oxidase. They used RT-PCR to clone 2 types of alternatively spliced DDO cDNAs from human brain RNA: DDO1, which encodes a 341-amino acid polypeptide, and DDO2, which encodes a 282-amino acid polypeptide. The human DDO1 protein has 86.4% amino acid identity with bovine DDO. Setoyama and Miura (1997) overexpressed human DDO1 and DDO2. They found that DDO1 produces a 37-kD protein that efficiently oxidizes D-aspartate and N-methyl-D-aspartate but not D-glutamate; DDO2 produces an insoluble protein whose functional role could not be determined. Barker and Hopkinson (1977) found rare genetically determined electrophoretic variants of D-aspartate oxidase in northern European populations. Indeed it is the existence of these variants that showed the autosomal inheritance and genetic separateness from D-amino acid oxidase.

comment: CLINICAL FEATURES Duane retraction syndrome is a congenital eye movement disorder characterized by a failure of cranial nerve VI (the abducens nerve) to develop normally, resulting in restriction or absence of abduction, restricted adduction, and narrowing of the palpebral fissure and retraction of the globe on attempted adduction. Undiagnosed in children, it can lead to amblyopia, a permanent uncorrectable loss of vision (Appukuttan et al., 1999). This unusual congenital form of strabismus was first described by Duane (1905), who collected reports of 54 cases. The condition is bilateral in 20% of cases. As discussed by Al-Baradie et al. (2002), Duane syndrome type 1 refers to marked or complete limitation of abduction with minimal or no limitation of adduction. Duane syndrome type 2 (604356) refers to marked or complete limitation of adduction with minimal or no limitation of abduction. Duane syndrome type 3 refers to marked or complete limitation of both abduction and adduction. The presence of more than 1 Duane syndrome type within a single pedigree was described by Chung et al. (2000) and Al-Baradie et al. (2002); see 607343.0004. Kim and Hwang (2005) analyzed whether the presence of the abducens nerve might depend upon the type of DRS. The abducens nerve on the affected side could not be observed using MRI in 18 of 18 eyes (16 patients) with type 1 DRS or in 3 of 5 eyes with type 3 DRS. Conversely, the abducens nerve was observed in 2 of 2 eyes with type 2 DRS and 2 of 5 eyes with type 3 DRS. The abducens nerve was observed in 60 of 60 eyes screened as controls. Thus, in terms of the presence or absence of the abducens nerve, type 1 and type 2 DRS were homogeneous and type 3 DRS was heterogeneous. In the study of 25 cases of sporadic Duane retraction syndrome by Wabbels et al. (2004), there was the usual excess of females with M/F ratio of 9/16 (64% females). There was bilateral involvement in only 12% of cases; the left eye was involved in 72%. HETEROGENEITY - Clinical Heterogeneity Chung et al. (2000) described the clinical diversity of hereditary Duane retraction syndrome in the 25 affected members of a 118-member, 3-generation family from Oaxaca, Mexico. Twenty-four affected individuals had bilateral DRS with a broad spectrum of severity. Strabismus occurred in 76% and amblyopia in 48%. Both strabismus and amblyopia were much more common in bilateral DRS than in unilateral DRS. Associated findings included fourth cranial nerve palsy, partial third cranial nerve palsy, nystagmus, seizures, and deafness. Fourth cranial nerve palsy and manifest strabismus tended to cluster within single family units. Chung et al. (2000) postulated that the responsible gene(s) may affect the development of many cranial nerves. They suggested that genetic compounding may play a role in the phenotypic segregation seen within this large family. - Association with other Anomalies Duane anomaly with associated deformity of the upper extremity was reported by Gifford (1926), Crisp (1918) and Mennerich (1923). Ferrell et al. (1966) described association of Duane anomaly with a heart-hand syndrome (probably Holt-Oram syndrome; see 142900) in a dominant pattern of inheritance. Hayes et al. (1985) gave the designation Okihiro syndrome (607323) to the combination of Duane anomaly, radial ray abnormalities, and deafness. This syndrome is referred to here as the Duane-radial ray syndrome (DRRS) for mnemonic reasons. Wildervanck syndrome (314600) 'consists of congenital, perceptive deafness, Klippel-Feil anomaly (fused cervical vertebrae), and abducens palsy with retractio bulbi (Duane syndrome).' INHERITANCE Up to 10% of cases of Duane anomaly are familial, with autosomal dominant inheritance (Gutowski, 2000). Transmission through 4 generations was reported by Cooper (1910) and through 3 generations by Waardenburg (1923), Laughlin (1937), and Zentmayer (1935). POPULATION GENETICS Appukuttan et al. (1999) cited a prevalence of approximately 0.1% in the general population and indicated that Duane retraction syndrome accounts for 5% of all strabismus cases. MAPPING Vincent et al. (1994) described a 'new' contiguous gene syndrome resulting from a de novo 8q12.2-q21.2 deletion and characterized by the branchiootorenal (BOR) syndrome (113650), the Duane syndrome, hydrocephalus (600256), and aplasia of the trapezius muscle (see 600257). This was the first reported localization of the gene responsible for Duane syndrome. Further information concerning the location of the Duane syndrome gene was provided by Calabrese et al. (1998) who reported on an insertion of the 8q13-q21.2 region onto band 6q25 in a patient presenting with Duane syndrome, mental retardation, and other dysmorphism. FISH analysis using a chromosome 8 radiation hybrid marker indicated a concurrent deletion within the 8q rearranged region. Studies by STR-PCR analysis and FISH using a YAC contig disclosed a deletion in 8q13. Comparison of the 2 known patients with Duane syndrome associated with deletion of 8q identified a small region of overlap of less than 3 cM extending from D8S533 to D8S1767. YAC analysis in the patient of Calabrese et al. (1998) showed that the 8q rearrangement was rather complex since 8q deletion and insertion occurred in 2 distinct segments separated by a region that maintained its location on 8q. The 7-year-old girl studied by Calabrese et al. (1998) presented with microcephaly, bilateral deficiency of ocular abduction, impairment of adduction, bilateral globe retraction, and narrowing of the interpalpebral fissure in adduction (Duane syndrome type 1, according to the classification of Huber (1974)), prominent nasal root, anteverted nares, and micrognathia. The patient had a short neck, brachydactyly, and left clubfoot. Mental retardation was severe. Ott et al. (1999) reported preliminary linkage analysis of a large Hispanic family showing bilateral autosomal dominant Duane retraction syndrome. They used microsatellite analysis to examine genomic DNA from 91 members of the 118-member pedigree spanning 3 generations and containing 25 affected individuals. They studied chromosomes 4, 8, and 22 because of previous reports of documented karyotypic abnormalities in unrelated patients with Duane retraction syndrome. No marker on any of these chromosomes had a lod score over 0.5, thus excluding them as candidate sites. The authors concluded that Duane retraction syndrome may result from mutations in a heterogeneous group of genes. Indeed, a locus for Duane syndrome has been located on chromosome 2q31 (see DURS2; 604356). Rickard et al. (2001) performed microsatellite analysis in a patient with a large deletion of the region of the EYA1 gene (601653) on 8q13.3, and compared its boundaries with other reported rearrangements of the region to which Duane syndrome had been mapped. The critical region for Duane syndrome was narrowed to an interval of approximately 1 cM between markers D8S553 and D8S1797. CYTOGENETICS Pizzuti et al. (2002) determined that a de novo reciprocal translocation t(6;8)(q26;q13) interrupted the CPAH gene (CPA6; 609562) in a 31-year-old man exhibiting features of Duane retraction syndrome. However, 18 patients with sporadic Duane retraction syndrome had polymorphic variants of the CPAH gene, but no pathogenetic abnormalities. MOLECULAR GENETICS In 25 cases of sporadic Duane retraction syndrome, Wabbels et al. (2004) found no mutations in the exons or neighboring intronic regions of the SALL4 gene. The results suggested that SALL4 mutation analysis is not recommended in nonfamilial Duane retraction syndrome, but careful clinical evaluation of the hands, the ears, the heart, and the kidney is required to exclude Okihiro syndrome (607323), which occurs in sporadic cases, and which in familial cases, like other autosomal dominant disorders, shows marked intra- and interfamilial variability.

comment: Endothelins belong to a family of potent vasoactive peptides consisting of 3 isopeptides, ET1 (131240), ET2 (131241), and ET3 (131242). A diverse set of pharmacologic activities with different potencies are exerted by endothelin family peptides, suggesting the existence of ET receptor subtypes. Takayanagi et al. (1991) described 2 distinct subclasses of ET receptors, namely, ET1-specific and ET-nonselective. Vane (1990) recommended that the ET1-specific type be called ETA and the nonselective type ETB. Nakamuta et al. (1991) isolated a cDNA encoding human ETB receptor from a cDNA library constructed from human liver. Hepatocytes have a considerable number of ET receptors linked to biologic actions such as glycogenolysis. The cDNA had an open reading frame encoding a protein of 442 amino acid residues with a relative mass of 49,643. The deduced amino acid sequence of the human ETB receptor was 88% and 64% identical to those of rat lung ETB receptor and bovine lung ET1-specific receptor, respectively. Ogawa et al. (1991) likewise isolated a nonisopeptide-selective human endothelin receptor from a human placenta cDNA library. The predicted protein had 442 amino acids with a transmembrane topology similar to that of other G protein-coupled receptors. Elshourbagy et al. (1996) isolated a novel splice variant of the endothelin-B receptor which they termed ETB-SVR. The sequence of the ETB-SVR receptor is identical to ETRB except for the intracellular C-terminal domain. The ETB-SVR receptor is expressed as a 2.7-kb mRNA in the lung, placenta, kidney, and skeletal muscle. Elshourbagy et al. (1996) transfected COS cells with ETB-SVR or ETRB and found that both receptors bind to ET1. However, while ETRB-transfected cells responded to ET1 with increases in inositol phosphate accumulation and intracellular acidification, ETB-SVR-transfected cells did not exhibit either of these responses to ET1. These data suggested to Elshourbagy et al. (1996) that ETB-SVR and ETRB are functionally distinct, and that the difference in the C-terminal amino acid sequences determines functional coupling. To investigate the influence of pregnancy-specific hormonal environment on expression of ET1 and ET1 receptor (EDNR), Bourgeois et al. (1997) investigated whether the muscular layer of stem villi vessels could be a site of the ET1 expression. The authors found that whereas both the A (EDNRA; 131242) and B forms of EDNR are present in stem villi vessels, placental vascular smooth muscle cells exclusively express the A form. Maggi et al. (2000) demonstrated that in FNC-B4 cells, which are derived from a human fetal olfactory epithelium, both sex steroids and odorants regulate GnRH secretion. They found biologic activity of EDN1 in this GnRH-secreting neuronal cell. In situ hybridization and immunohistochemistry revealed gene and protein expression of EDN1 and its converting enzyme (ECE1; 600423) in both fetal olfactory mucosa and FNC-B4 cells. Experiments with radiolabeled EDN1 and EDN3 strongly indicated the presence of 2 classes of binding sites, corresponding to the ETA (16,500 sites/cell) and the ETB receptors (8,700 sites/cell). Functional studies using selective analogs indicated that these 2 classes of receptors subserve distinct functions in human GnRH-secreting cells. The ETA receptor subtype mediated an increase in intracellular calcium and GnRH secretion. Endothelin-1 inhibits active Na-K transport by as much as 50% in the renal tubule and other tissues (Zeidel et al., 1989). Okafor and Delamere (2001) noted that the presence of low levels of ET1 in aqueous humor combined with the potential for release of ET1 from ciliary processes suggested that the crystalline lens could be exposed to ET1 in vivo. They studied the influence of ET1 on active Na-K transport in the porcine lens. Their results suggested that ET1 inhibited active lens Na-K transport by activating EDNRA and EDNRB. Activation of the ET receptors also caused an increase in cytoplasmic calcium concentration in cultured lens epithelial cells. Both responses to ET1 appear to have a tyrosine kinase step. Arai et al. (1993) demonstrated that the human genome contains a single copy of the ETRB gene, which spans 24 kb and comprises 7 exons and 6 introns. Every intron occurs near the border of the putative transmembrane domain in the coding region. Using human/rodent somatic hybrid cell lines, they assigned the ETRB gene to human chromosome 13. Puffenberger et al. (1994) presented evidence that Hirschsprung disease type 2 (HSCR2; 600155), an apparently multigenic disorder, is due to mutation in the endothelin-B receptor gene. EDNRB was a candidate gene because it mapped to the same region of chromosome 13 as did HSCR2. The mutation was dosage sensitive in that homozygotes and heterozygotes had a 74% and a 21% risk, respectively, of developing HSCR. Other analyses of patients in the extended Mennonite pedigree showed that HSCR is a multigenic disorder. For all clinical forms of HSCR, there is a greater incidence of megacolon in males than in females and the same was true for the specific EDNRB mutation. Among the Mennonites, at least 5 megacolon patients did not seem to carry the specific EDNRB mutation trp276 to cys (W276C) present in most of the affected members. This suggested the existence of as yet undiscovered HSCR susceptibility genes. Among the affected Mennonites, HSCR was associated with nonenteric phenotypes in several: bicolored irides (6.3%), hypopigmentation (2.5%), sensorineural hearing loss (5.1%), and white forelock (7.6%), reminiscent of the Shah-Waardenburg syndrome (277580). Puffenberger et al. (1994) suggested that these nonenteric features represented pleiotropic effects of the W276C mutation. They pointed out that the mouse piebald mutation 's' demonstrates white coat spotting as the only phenotypic trait, while the piebald-lethal mouse 's(l)' has megacolon in addition to white coat color (Lane, 1966). Hosoda et al. (1994) found that targeted and natural ('piebald-lethal') mutations of the Ednrb mouse result in megacolon associated with spotted coat color. Baynash et al. (1994) showed that a targeted disruption of the mouse endothelin-3 ligand (131242) results in a similar recessive phenotype of megacolon and coat color spotting. This and other findings indicated that interaction of EDN3 with the endothelin-B receptor is essential to the development of neural crest-derived cell lineages. Baynash et al. (1994) suggested that defects in the human EDN3 gene, which is located on chromosome 20, may cause Hirschsprung disease. Kusafuka et al. (1996) analyzed 7 exons for mutations in the EDNRB gene in 41 isolated patients with HSCR. Two novel mutations were detected (131244.0003 and 131244.0004). Both patients with the novel mutations were heterozygotes. No information was provided on the families of these 2 cases, but the presumption was that they represented new mutations. Amiel et al. (1996) reported 3 missense mutations in the EDNRB gene in heterozygous state in sporadic cases of HSCR. Chakravarti (1996) tabulated 12 mutations in the EDNRB gene identified in cases of Hirschsprung disease up to that time. Among 31 isolated cases of Hirschsprung disease in non-inbred populations in Japan, Tanaka et al. (1998) identified 3 new mutations in the EDNRB gene: 2 transversions, A to T and C to A at nucleotides 311 (N104I) and 1170 (S390R), respectively, and a T-to-C transition at nucleotide 325 (C109R). To analyze the functions of these mutant receptors, they were expressed in Chinese hamster ovary cells. The authors found that N104I receptors showed almost the same binding affinities and functional properties as the wildtype and might represent a polymorphism. On the other hand, although S390R did not change the binding affinities, it caused decreases in the ligand-induced increment of intracellular calcium and in the inhibition of adenylyl cyclase activity, showing the impairment of the intracellular signaling. C109R receptors were proved to be localized near the nuclei as an unusual 44-kD protein with an extremely low affinity to endothelin-1 and not to be translocated into the plasma membrane. Chakravarti (1996) estimated that RET (164761) mutations account for approximately 50% of HSCR cases and EDNRB mutations account for approximately 5%. Short-segment HSCR occurs in about 25% of RET-caused cases and in more than 95% of EDNRB-related cases. Whereas homozygosity for the EDNRB gene causes deafness and pigmentary anomalies in addition to HSCR (e.g., 131244.0002), the homozygous phenotype for RET has not been observed. In a child with ABCD syndrome (600501) reported by Gross et al. (1995), Verheij et al. (2002) identified a homozygous nonsense mutation in the EDNRB gene (131244.0008). The 5-prime region of EDNRB is a complex CpG island giving rise to 4 individual transcripts initiating within the island. Pao et al. (2001) analyzed the relationship between methylation and EDNRB expression in human tissues. The CpG island was unmethylated in normal prostate and bladder tissue, whereas it was methylated in colonic epithelium; DNA from tumors derived from these tissues was frequently hypermethylated. Analysis of 11 individual CpG sites in the CpG island showed that specific sites with high methylation levels in several tumors and cancer cell lines were also methylated in normal tissues, suggesting that these sites might serve as foci for further de novo methylation. A low methylation level in a small region within the 5-prime region correlated with expression of the 5-prime-most transcript, whereas almost complete methylation 200 to 1000 bp downstream of the transcriptional start site did not block expression of this transcript. Treatment with 5-aza-2-prime-deoxycytidine induced transcriptional activation of all 4 EDNRB transcripts. The authors concluded that there is differential, tissue-dependent methylation at the EDNRB 5-prime region, and that hypermethylation immediately 3-prime to the transcriptional start site does not prevent initiation. They further proposed a spreading mechanism for de novo methylation, starting from particular methylation hotspots. Carrasquillo et al. (2002) noted that although 8 genes with mutations that can be associated with Hirschsprung disease had been identified, mutations at individual loci are neither necessary nor sufficient to cause clinical disease. They conducted a genomewide association study in 43 Mennonite family trios (parents and affected child) using 2,083 microsatellites and SNPs and a new multipoint linkage disequilibrium method that searched for association arising from common ancestry. They identified susceptibility loci at 10q11, 13q22, and 16q23; they showed that the gene at 13q22 is EDNRB and the gene at 10q11 is RET. Statistically significant joint transmission of RET and EDNRB alleles in affected individuals and noncomplementation of aganglionosis in mouse intercrosses between Ret null and the Ednrb hypomorphic piebald allele were suggestive of epistasis between EDNRB and RET. Thus, genetic interaction between mutations in RET and EDNRB is an underlying mechanism for this complex disorder. Endothelin-1 (EDN1; 131240) is synthesized by keratinocytes in normal skin and is locally released after cutaneous injury. It is able to trigger pain through its actions on endothelin-A receptors (EDNRA; 131243) of local nociceptors, but coincidentally produces analgesia through endothelin-B receptors. Khodorova et al. (2003) mapped an endogenous analgesic circuit, in which endothelin-B receptor activation induces the release of beta-endorphin from keratinocytes and the activation of G protein-coupled inwardly rectifying potassium channels (GIRKs, also called Kir-3) linked to opioid receptors on nociceptors. These results indicated the existence of an intrinsic feedback mechanism to control peripheral pain in skin, and established keratinocytes as an endothelin-B receptor-operated opioid pool. Using gene expression profiling, Iwashita et al. (2003) determined that genes associated with Hirschsprung disease were highly upregulated in rat gut neural crest stem cells relative to whole-fetus RNA. The genes with highest expression were GDNF (600837), SOX10 (602229), GFRA1 (601496), and EDNRB. The highest expression was seen in RET (164761), which was found to be necessary for neural crest stem cell migration in the gut. GDNF promoted the migration of neural crest stem cells in culture but did not affect their survival or proliferation. The observations made by Iwashita et al. (2003) were confirmed by quantitative RT-PCR, flow cytometry, and functional analysis. ANIMAL MODEL The autosomal recessive 'spotting lethal' (sl) mutation in the rat is characterized by absence of intramural ganglion cells in the entire colon and distal small bowel, thus resembling human Hirschsprung disease. Ceccherini et al. (1995) excluded linkage of sl with 2 candidate genes, RET proto-oncogene (RET; 164761) and endothelin-3; however, a highly significant lod score (Z = 47.05 at theta = 0.0) was found between EDNRB and the sl phenotype. The exon-intron structure of the rat gene was reconstructed and each exon of the sl rat was screened for mutations. A 301-bp interstitial deletion, encompassing the distal half of the first coding exon (exon 2) and the proximal part of the adjacent intron, was demonstrated. This deletion resulted in 2 transcriptional products, 270 and 238 bp shorter than wildtype cDNA. Gariepy et al. (1996) showed that the deletion perfectly cosegregates with the sl phenotype. The deletion leads to production of an aberrantly spliced EDNRB mRNA that lacks the coding sequence for the first and second putative transmembrane domains of the G protein-coupled receptor. Radioligand binding assays revealed undetectable levels of functional EDNRB in tissues from homozygous sl/sl rats. Thus, the authors concluded that EDNRB plays an essential role in the normal development of 2 neural crest-derived cell lineages, epidermal melanocytes and enteric neurons, in 3 mammalian species--humans, mice, and rats. They stated that rats lacking EDNRB may prove valuable in studies of adult physiology in health and diseases, if the sl rat can be rescued from the lethal megacolon phenotype. Gariepy et al. (1998) demonstrated that during normal rat development the EDNRB mRNA expression pattern is consistent with expression by enteric nervous system (ENS) precursors throughout gut colonization. They used the human dopamine-beta-hydroxylase (DBH; 223360) promoter to direct transgenic expression of EDNRB to colonizing ENS precursors in the sl/sl rat. The DBH-EDNRB transgene compensated for deficient endogenous EDNRB in these rats and prevented the development of congenital intestinal aganglionosis. The transgene had no effect on coat color spotting, indicating the critical time for EDNRB expression in ENS development begins after separation of the melanocyte lineage from the ENS lineage and a common precursor. The transgene dosage affected both the incidence and severity of the congenital intestinal defect, suggesting dosage-dependent events downstream of EDNRB activation in ENS development. Shin et al. (1997) attempted to identify the important domains for EDNRB function by studying 4 recessive juvenile lethal alleles in the mouse Ednrb gene created either by radiation or chemical mutagens. Molecular defects were identified in 3; in 1 mutation, which is associated with normal levels of Ednrb mRNA in adult brain, the mutation appeared to affect important regulatory elements that mediate the expression of the gene during development. Lethal white foal syndrome (LWFS) is a congenital anomaly of horses resembling Hirschsprung disease characterized by a white coat color and aganglionosis of the bowel. To investigate the molecular basis of LWFS, Yang et al. (1998) demonstrated that a full-length cDNA for horse EDNRB contains a 1,329-bp open reading frame that encoded 443 amino acid residues. The predicted amino acid sequence was 89%, 91%, and 85% identical to human, bovine, and mouse/rat EDNRB sequences, respectively, but only 55% identical to the human, bovine, and rat EDNRA sequences. When homozygous, a dinucleotide mutation, TC-to-AG, which changed isoleucine to lysine in the predicted first transmembrane domain of the EDNRB protein, was found as the basis of LWFS; the heterozygous state resulted in the 'overo' phenotype. The dinucleotide mutation involved nucleotides 353 and 354. It had previously been known that LWFS is produced most often by mating horses with the overo color pattern. One mutant allele produces the coat color change but the presence of at least 1 normal allele appears to protect against the development of aganglionosis. Metallinos et al. (1998) also showed that an ile118-to-lys missense mutation in EDNRB is responsible for lethal white foal syndrome. Breedings between particular spotted horses, generally described as frame overo, produce some foals that, in contrast to their parents, are all white or nearly all white and die shortly after birth of severe intestinal blockage. These foals have aganglionosis characterized by a lack of submucosal and myenteric ganglia from the distal small intestine to the large intestine, similar to human Hirschsprung disease. Metallinos et al. (1998) found that lethal white foal syndrome occurred in homozygotes; heterozygotes showed the frame overo pattern. Horses with tobiano markings included some carriers, indicating that tobiano is epistatic to frame overo. In addition, some horses identified as carriers had no recognized overo coat pattern phenotype, demonstrating the variable penetrance of the mutation. Santschi et al. (1998) likewise studied the ile118-to-lys change in the overo lethal white syndrome in foals born to American Paint Horse parents of the overo coat pattern lineage. To determine when EDNRB signaling is required during embryogenesis, Shin et al. (1999) exploited the tetracycline-inducible system to generate strains of mice that expressed Ednrb at different stages of embryogenesis. Shin et al. (1999) determined that Ednrb is required during a restricted period of neural crest development between embryonic days 10 and 12.5. Shin et al. (1999) concluded that EDNRB is required for the migration of both melanoblasts and enteric neuroblasts. The role of the endothelin-B receptor in vascular homeostasis is controversial because the receptor has both pressor and depressor effects in vivo. Spotting lethal rats carry a naturally occurring deletion in the endothelin-B receptor gene that completely abrogates functional receptor expression. Rats homozygous for this mutation die shortly after birth due to congenital distal intestinal aganglionosis. Genetic rescue of homozygous rats from this developmental defect using a dopamine hydroxylase-EDNRB transgene resulted in ETB-deficient adult rats Gariepy et al. (2000). On a sodium-deficient diet, the rats exhibited a normal arterial blood pressure, but on a high-sodium diet the homozygous sl rats became severely hypertensive. Normal pressure was restored in the salt-fed rats when the epithelial sodium channel was blocked with amiloride. Gariepy et al. (2000) concluded that the rescued sl/sl rats are a novel single-locus genetic model of severe salt-sensitive hypertension. The results suggested that these rats are hypertensive because they lack the normal tonic inhibition of the renal epithelial sodium channel. Matsushima et al. (2002) described a novel mutant mouse with a mutation in the Ednrb gene and proposed the mouse as an animal model of Waardenburg syndrome 4 (WS4; 277580), or Waardenburg-Shah syndrome, which combines Hirschsprung disease with features of Waardenburg syndrome. These mutants had a mixed genetic background and extensive white spotting. They died between 2 and 7 weeks after birth owing to megacolon; their colon distal to the megacolon lacked Auerbach plexus cells. These mutants did not respond to sound, and the stria vascularis of their cochleas lacked intermediate cells, i.e., neural crest-derived melanocytes. The inheritance was autosomal recessive as in human WS4. Breeding analysis revealed that WS4 mice are allelic with piebald-lethal and JF1 mice, which are also mutated in the Ednrb gene. Mutation analysis showed that the Ednrb gene lacked 318 nucleotides encoding transmembrane domains owing to deletion of exons 2 and 3. Interaction between endothelin-3 (131242) and its receptor is required for normal differentiation and development of melanocytes and Auerbach plexus cells. Carpenter et al. (2003) studied pulmonary edema formation in EDNRB-deficient rats. In normoxia, EDNRB -/- rats had significantly more lung vascular leak than heterozygotes or controls. Hypoxia increased vascular leak regardless of genotype, and hypoxic EDNRB-deficient rats leaked more than hypoxic controls. EDNRB-deficient rats had higher lung endothelin levels in both normoxia and hypoxia. Lung hypoxia-inducible factor-1-alpha (HIF1A; 603348) and vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF; 192240) levels were greater in the EDNRB-deficient rats in both normoxia and hypoxia, and both levels were reduced by EDNRA antagonism. Both EDNRA blockade and VEGF antagonism reduced vascular leak in hypoxic EDNRB-deficient rats. Carpenter et al. (2003) concluded that EDNRB-deficient rats display an exaggerated lung vascular protein leak in normoxia, that hypoxia exacerbates that leak, and that this effect is in part attributable to an endothelin-mediated increase in lung VEGF content. Migration of the precursors of the enteric nervous system (ENS) into the colon requires expression of the EDNRB gene at a defined time. In studies in mice, Zhu et al. (2004) found a conserved spatiotemporal ENS enhancer of Ednrb. This 1-kb enhancer was activated as the ENS precursors approached the colon, and partial deletion of the enhancer at the endogenous Ednrb locus resulted in pigmented mice that died postnatally from megacolon. In the Ednrb ENS enhancer, they identified binding sites for Sox10 (602229), an SRY-related transcription factor associated with Hirschsprung disease, and mutational analyses of these sites suggested that SOX10 may have multiple roles in regulating EDNRB in the ENS. In adult transgenic mice with conditional cardiac-restricted ET1 overexpression, Yang et al. (2004) observed nuclear factor kappa-B (see 164011) translocation, cytokine expression, inflammation and hypertrophy, resulting in dilated cardiomyopathy, congestive heart failure, and death as early as 5 weeks after transgene induction. Significant prolongation of survival was observed with a combined EDNRA/EDNRB antagonist but not with an EDNRA-selective antagonist, consistent with an important role for EDNRB in this model.

comment: CLONING Mutation at the mouse 'limb deformity' (ld) locus disrupts embryonic pattern formation, resulting in a reduction and fusion of the distal bones and digits of all limbs as well as variable incidence of renal aplasia. Woychik et al. (1990) characterized the ld locus at the molecular level and identified a complex gene which, because of its presumed role in the formation of limbs and kidneys, was designated formin. Maas et al. (1991) described sequence and restriction-mapping data for a human genomic clone that contained 2 major human-mouse homology regions. They assigned the locus symbol LD to the human gene locus. They also demonstrated 2 frequently occurring DNA polymorphisms at the LD locus potentially useful for testing linkage to human syndromes that combine limb and renal abnormalities. Vogt et al. (1993) showed that the large and complex LD gene has the capacity to generate a number of alternatively spliced mRNA transcripts encoding nuclear protein isoforms called formins. They made polyclonal antibodies to specific formin peptides and confirmed the authenticity of the reactivity of the antibodies, using cell lines derived from mice with molecularly defined mutations at the ld locus. GENE FUNCTION Zuniga et al. (1999) reported that the secreted bone morphogenetic protein (BMP) antagonist Gremlin (603054) relays the sonic hedgehog (SHH; 600725) signal from the polarizing region to the apical ectodermal ridge. Mesenchymal Gremlin expression is lost in limb buds of mouse embryos homozygous for the ld mutation, which disrupts establishment of the Shh/Fgf4 (164980) feedback loop. Grafting Gremlin-expressing cells into ld mutant limb buds rescued Fgf4 expression and restored the Shh/Fgf4 feedback loop. Analysis of Shh-null mutant embryos revealed that Shh signaling is required for maintenance of Gremlin and Formin, the gene disrupted by the ld mutations. In contrast, Formin, Gremlin, and Fgf4 activation were independent of Shh signaling. Zuniga et al. (1999) concluded that the study uncovered the cascade by which the SHH signal is relayed from the posterior mesenchyme to the apical ectodermal ridge and established that Formin-dependent activation of the BMP antagonist Gremlin is sufficient to induce FGF4 and establish the SHH/FGF4 feedback loop. Using a yeast 2-hybrid system to analyze alpha-catenin (see 116805) binding partners, Kobielak et al. (2004) found direct interaction between alpha-catenin and formin in a mouse skin expression library. In addition, they found that formin nucleated the polymerization of unbranched actin (see 102610) filaments in vitro and functioned in vivo in alpha-catenin-dependent, radial actin cable formation. GENE STRUCTURE Wang et al. (1997) found that the mouse Fmn gene is very large, spanning 400 kb and comprising at least 24 exons. Wang et al. (1997) stated that some of the introns are very large, ranging more than 50 kb, and may play a role in transcriptional regulation. MAPPING Maas et al. (1991) showed by a combination of mouse/human somatic cell hybrid studies and in situ hybridization that the human LD gene is located on 15q13-q14. Both this and the beta-2-microglobulin gene (109700) are located on chromosome 2 in the mouse. Richard et al. (1992) mapped the LD locus on chromosome 15, proximal to the gene for cardiac muscle alpha-actin (ACTC; 102540). Although linkage was shown to the gene for limb-girdle muscular dystrophy (LGMD2; 253600), a recombination fraction of 6 to 11% indicated that the LD locus is not implicated in the pathogenesis of LGMD2. Richard et al. (1994) mapped 149 chromosome 15 loci, including those for 18 genes, 60 cDNA-derived sequence-tagged sites (STS), and 69 microsatellites by PCR with respect to chromosome breakpoints in 3 somatic cell hybrids retaining all or part of chromosome 15 and to a 10-Mb YAC contig. Chromosome 15 was divided into 5 regions, yielding an average resolution of more than 1 sequence tagged site per megabase. They mapped the FMN gene to their region I: 15pter-q14. ANIMAL MODEL The murine 'limb deformity' (ld) locus is defined by several different noncomplementing mutant alleles which share a characteristic limb deformity and variably penetrant renal aplasia phenotype (Green, 1981; Woychik et al., 1985; Woychik et al., 1990). The limb deformity is marked by synostoses and syndactyly of all 4 limbs. The renal defect consists of unilateral or bilateral renal aplasia. The relationship between Gremlin and Fmn is interesting because of their proximity in the mouse genome. The Fmn transcript comprises a large number of exons with the most 3-prime exon located approximately 40 kb from the Gremlin open reading frame. Given the apparently identical phenotype of ld mice to Gremlin mutant mice and the proximity of Fmn to Gremlin, Khokha et al. (2003) tested whether Gremlin would complement ld. They found that Gremlin fails to complement ld and thus identified another ld allele. Although a complex interaction between Fmn and Gremlin is possible, Khokha et al. (2003) favored the idea that the ld mutations affect Gremlin expression directly and that they lie in cis-regulatory elements for Gremlin expression.

comment: A number sign (#) is used with this entry because of evidence that the disorder represents a contiguous gene syndrome due to a deletion in chromosome 16p that involves the alpha-1 (HBA1; 141800) and alpha-2 (HBA2; 141850) genes. X-linked alpha-thalassemia/mental retardation syndrome (ATR-X; 301040) is a similar phenotypic disorder caused by mutation in the ATRX gene (300032). CLINICAL FEATURES Weatherall et al. (1981) reported the association of hemoglobin H disease (Hb H; see alpha-thalassemias, 141800) and mental retardation in 3 unrelated patients of northern European descent. Hjelle et al. (1982) described a somewhat similar case in a male of northern European extraction. Hb H was associated with multiple congenital anomalies: spina bifida from T6 to the sacrum with a T10-L4 myelomeningocele, congenital cataracts, bilateral inguinal hernias, bilateral deformities of the femoral necks, and subluxation of the left hip. One of his 2 sibs also had congenital cataracts, but there was no family history of other congenital anomalies or of fetal wastage. According to restriction enzyme analyses, the father had 2 alpha-globin genes on one chromosome and only 1 gene on the homolog (i.e., was a silent alpha-thalassemia carrier), whereas the mother had cis alpha-thalassemia trait (i.e., 2 alpha genes on 1 chromosome and none on the homolog). The proband had the thalassemia chromosome of each parent. The restriction patterns were typical of Asian alpha-thalassemia. The brother with congenital cataracts carried the father's thalassemic chromosome. Higgs et al. (1989) stated that they were aware of 13 individuals, 10 males and 3 females from a variety of racial groups, with this association. Nine of the patients had Hb H disease, with hypochromic microcytic anemia and 1 to 11% of Hb H in the peripheral blood. The other 4 had alpha-thalassemia trait with only occasional Hb H-containing cells. In all cases, family studies showed that alpha-thalassemia in the proband resulted entirely or in part from a de novo mutation affecting alpha-globin production. Wilkie et al. (1990) reported 8 unrelated patients with mental retardation and alpha-thalassemia due to deletions of chromosome 16p, including patients previously reported by Weatherall et al. (1981), Borochovitz et al. (1970) and Bowcock et al. (1984), Hutz et al. (1986), and Buckle et al. (1988). Molecular genetic analysis of all 8 patients showed that each failed to inherit an alpha-globin allele from 1 of the parents and had deletions of variable size in band 16p13.3. In at least 4 cases, the deletion resulted from unbalanced chromosome translocation; hence aneuploidy of a second chromosome was also present. The clinical features varied widely and were relatively nonspecific. Lindor et al. (1997) described a female infant of mixed northern European ancestry in which alpha-thalassemia was ascertained by newborn screening. Evaluation at 9 months of age showed minor anomalies and developmental delay. Chromosomal analysis demonstrated a de novo deletion of the most distal portion of 16p. By fluorescence in situ hybridization it was established that the anomaly was a terminal deletion with a breakpoint at 16p13.3, and not a translocation. This was said to have been only the fifth reported case of the ATR-16 chromosome that was not complicated by duplication or deletion in other chromosomes. They suggested that ATR-16 is underdiagnosed, since making the diagnosis is confounded by the mildness of the phenotype, the high frequency of alpha-thalassemia trait in many populations, the subtlety of cytogenetic findings, and the lack of altered Southern blot band sizes. Holinski-Feder et al. (2000) reported a 5-generation family in which 10 individuals of both sexes had mild to moderate mental retardation and mild nonspecific dysmorphic features. The disorder was inherited in a seemingly autosomal dominant fashion with reduced penetrance. Standard clinical and laboratory screening protocols and extended cytogenetic analysis, including the use of high-resolution karyotyping and multiplex FISH, did not reveal the cause of the mental retardation. However, a genomewide scan showed linkage to chromosome 16p13.3, and a deletion of part of 16pter was demonstrated in patients, similar to the deletion observed in patients with ATR-16 syndrome. Subsequent FISH analysis demonstrated that the patients in this family inherited a duplication of terminal 3q in addition to the deletion of 16p. FISH analysis of obligate carriers revealed that a balanced translocation between the terminal parts of 16p and 3q segregated in this family. Affected individuals had hematologic parameters consistent with mild alpha-thalassemia. Holinski-Feder et al. (2000) emphasized the role of cryptic, cytogenetically invisible subtelomeric translocations in mental retardation, which has been estimated to be implicated in 5 to 10% of cases (Flint et al., 1995; Giraudeau et al., 1997; Slavotinek et al., 1999). Gallego et al. (2005) described a child with ATR-16 syndrome who had been referred for genetic evaluation because of minor anomalies and developmental delay. Cytogenetic analysis showed a de novo complex rearrangement of chromosome 16. FISH analysis, using chromosome 16 subtelomeric probes, showed that the patient had a deletion of the distal short arm of chromosome 16 that contains the alpha-globin genes and a duplication of 16q. Southern blot analysis of the alpha-globin locus showed a half-normal dose of the alpha-globin genes. Microsatellite marker studies showed that the duplicated chromosome 16q region was maternal in origin. Hematologic studies showed anemia, hypochromia, and occasional cells with Hb H inclusion bodies. Gallego et al. (2005) concluded that a hematologic screening for alpha-thalassemia should be considered in patients with mild developmental delay and a suggestive phenotype of ATR-16 with microcytic hypochromic anemia and normal iron status. They suggested that the finding in this patient of a stellate pattern of the iris may be useful in the clinical delineation of ATR-16 and/or duplication of 16qter. Gallego et al. (2005) stated that approximately 15 cases of ATR-16 had been described and that 'only a handful of cases involving duplication of 16q22-qter' had been reported among liveborns. MOLECULAR GENETICS Pfeifer et al. (2000) stated that the SOX8 gene (605923) was found to be deleted in a patient with ATR-16 syndrome who carried a deletion of approximately 2 Mb from 16p13.3. Based on the high expression of SOX8 in the brain, they suggested that haploinsufficiency for the SOX8 protein could contribute to the mental retardation found in ATR-16 syndrome. Lamb et al. (1993) restudied a South African Dutch patient with mental retardation who was originally reported by Borochovitz et al. (1970) to have a normal karyotype and was later found by Wilkie et al. (1990) to have a subtle shortening of band 16p13.3 of one chromosome 16 homolog. Lamb et al. (1993) showed that the patient had a truncation of the terminal 2 Mb of 16p and that the telomeric sequence (TTAGGG)n had been added at the site of breakage. The chromosomal break, which was paternal in origin and had probably arisen at meiosis, had apparently been stabilized in vivo by the direct addition of the telomeric sequence.

comment: A number sign (#) is used with this entry because of evidence that the phenotype can result from mutation in any one of several different genes operating either alone or in combination. These mutations include dominant mutations in the RET gene (164761) and a recessive mutation in the endothelin receptor type B gene (EDNRB; 131244) on 13q22; see also Hirschsprung disease-2 (600155). The genes for endothelin-3 (131242), glial cell line-derived neurotrophic factor (600837), and endothelin converting enzyme-1 (ECE1; 600423) have also been implicated in HSCR. Hofstra et al. (1997) pointed out that mutations of these genes give dominant, recessive, or polygenic patterns of inheritance. Hirschsprung disease, with major and modifying sequence variants in a variety of genes, may serve as a model for other complex disorders for which the search for defective genes has begun. Evidence suggests that the genetics of long-segment Hirschsprung disease and short-segment Hirschsprung disease is different. Bolk Gabriel et al. (2002) demonstrated the oligogenic basis of short-segment Hirschsprung disease with RET as the major gene, and genes on 3p21 (HSCRS2; 606874) and 19q12 (HSCRS3; 606875) as RET-dependent modifiers. Another gene involved in Hirschsprung disease is ZFHX1B (605802), the site of mutations causing the Hirschsprung disease-mental retardation syndrome (235730). Passarge (2002) reviewed the genes implicated in Hirschsprung disease. HSCR modifier loci have also been reported; see 600156 and 608462. Emison et al. (2005) identified a common sex-dependent mutation in a RET enhancer-like sequence that is significantly associated with Hirschsprung disease susceptibility (164761.0050). Carrasquillo et al. (2002) used a genomewide association study and a mouse model to identify interaction between the RET and EDNRB pathways in the pathogenesis of Hirschsprung disease. The disorder described by Hirschsprung (1888) and known as Hirschsprung disease or aganglionic megacolon is a congenital disorder characterized by absence of enteric ganglia along a variable length of the intestine. For a long time this disorder was considered to be multifactorial in its inheritance with the possible operation of a major autosomal recessive gene. Indeed, this disorder appeared in the autosomal recessive catalog (without an asterisk) through many editions. As an increasing number of surviving patients reached child-bearing age, families consistent with autosomal dominant inheritance were reported by Carter et al. (1981), Lipson and Harvey (1987), and Lipson et al. (1990). Linkage studies, detailed later, supported the autosomal dominant inheritance of this disorder. Boggs and Kidd (1958) described sibs with absence of the innervation of the entire intestinal tract below the ligament of Treitz. Bodian and Carter (1963) suggested that cases of Hirschsprung disease with extensive involvement of the gut, such as those reported by Boggs and Kidd (1958), are more likely to be familial. For the series of Hirschsprung disease as a whole, they could not demonstrate simple mendelian inheritance. They concluded that Hirschsprung disease is probably multifactorial (polygenic) in its causation. Multifactorial traits have a 'sliding' risk. Not only does the recurrence risk increase as the number of affected sibs increases, but it also is greater when involvement is more severe. Thus it is not unexpected that cases with more extensive involvement are more likely to be familial. Passarge (1967) arrived at a similar conclusion of multifactorial inheritance. Empiric risk figures were as follows: 7.2% for the sibs of an affected female, 2.6% for the sibs of an affected male. In at least 4 instances, parent-child involvement is known (Ehrenpreis, 1970). In all 4 cases, the parent was the mother. Aganglionic megacolon is clearly a heterogeneous category. It is a frequent finding in cases of trisomy 21 (Down syndrome). See the review by Passarge (1993) who gave a listing of disorders in which congenital intestinal aganglionosis is a feature. Six of 63 probands in the Passarge (1967) study were cases of Down syndrome. Garver et al. (1985) confirmed the relatively high frequency of Hirschsprung disease in Down syndrome (5.9%). Of 134 cases, 103 had short-segment disease and 31 had the long-segment type of aganglionosis. For the 2 types, the sex ratio was 5.4 and 1.4, respectively. Quinn et al. (1994) cited a 10 to 15% incidence of HSCR in trisomy 21. Sakai et al. (1999) described a 1-year-old male patient with short-segment sporadic HSCR associated with Down syndrome. Two mutations were found: a de novo T-to-A heterozygous transition at the splicing donor site of intron 10 of the RET gene, and a G-to-A substitution in exon 1 in the noncoding region of the EDNRB gene, inherited from the mother. They stated that no patient had been described with point mutations in different loci known to lead to HSCR. Other syndromes in which Hirschsprung disease occurs include cartilage-hair hypoplasia (250250), Smith-Lemli-Opitz syndrome (270400), and primary central hypoventilation syndrome (Ondine-Hirschsprung disease; 209880). Skinner and Irvine (1973) described 4 unrelated patients with Hirschsprung disease and profound congenital deafness. There were no stigmata of Waardenburg syndrome, which is sometimes accompanied by megacolon (see 193500). Megacolon has also been reported in familial piebaldness (172800); Hultgren (1982) reported the same in the horse. The lethal white foal syndrome is a congenital abnormality of overo spotted horses which appears to be a model for human aganglionic megacolon. Affected foals are all white or nearly all white and succumb to intestinal obstruction in the first few days of life. (The designation 'overo' comes from the Spanish for 'egg-colored' or 'speckled.') McCabe et al. (1990) described 2 affected foals and discussed 2 possible mechanisms of inheritance. In mice, aganglionic megacolon is associated with piebald trait and is inherited apparently as an autosomal recessive (Bielschowsky and Schofield, 1962). McKusick (1966) observed a child with heterochromia iridis and megacolon (R.C., 943266) who also had congenital deafness. Liang et al. (1983) reported a Mexican family in which 2 brothers and a sister of second-cousin parents had Hirschsprung disease and bicolored irides. (They used the term 'bicolor' rather than the more usual 'heterochromia' to emphasize that 2 distinct colors were present in the same iris.) They suggested that the inheritance was autosomal recessive. This may have been been the Waardenburg-Shah syndrome, which is a recessive disorder (277580). Kim et al. (1994) reported a 15-year-old dysmorphic boy who was found to have Hirschsprung disease shortly after birth. In addition, he had pharyngeal webbing, short stature, microcephaly, ptosis, and dysmorphic features characterized by a flat occiput, receding forehead, low anterior hairline, bushy eyebrows, long eyelashes, anteverted ears, high nasal bridge, long nose, small mandible, and severe malocclusion. Developmental delay, speech abnormalities, ataxia, spasticity, and scoliosis developed later. A muscle biopsy performed when he was 15 years old demonstrated numerous minicores as well as a preponderance of type 1 fibers and fiber type disproportion. Chromosomes were normal. The patient's brother had mild developmental delay. Multicore myopathy (see 602771) in association with mental retardation and short stature has been reported with hypogonadism (253320), but the association with Hirschsprung disease is novel. A paternal cousin of the proband had Hirschsprung disease but no other abnormalities. Lipson and Harvey (1987) described nonsyndromic, biopsy-proven Hirschsprung disease involving both short and long segments of the large bowel in members of 3 successive generations, with a total of 4 definitely affected members and 2 probably affected members. The authors suggested that because of improved diagnosis and treatment over the last few decades, other such families may be described. Lipson et al. (1990) provided further information on the family: the affected mother of the propositus (a member of the third generation) had another child with Hirschsprung disease affecting the entire large bowel, who was fathered by a different man. A history of long-segment Hirschsprung disease in a half cousin who had normal parents and grandparents suggested multifactorial inheritance with females, when affected, having a higher likelihood of transmitting the condition to their children. Lipson et al. (1990) pointed to a male predominance of 3:1 to 5:1 in Hirschsprung disease. Badner et al. (1990) performed complex segregation analysis of data on 487 probands and their families. An increased sex ratio (3.9 males:1 female) and an elevated risk to sibs (4%), as compared with the population incidence (0.02%), were observed, with the sex ratio decreasing and the recurrence risk to sibs increasing as the aganglionosis became more extensive. For cases with aganglionosis beyond the sigmoid colon, the mode of inheritance was compatible with a dominant gene with incomplete penetrance, while for cases with aganglionosis extending no farther than the sigmoid colon, the inheritance pattern was equally likely to be either multifactorial or due to a recessive gene with very low penetrance. Auricchio et al. (1996) raised the intriguing hypothesis that CIIPX (300048) may represent an additional, X-linked susceptibility locus in Hirschsprung disease. Staiano et al. (1999) evaluated the autonomic nervous system in patients with Hirschsprung disease. Pupillary and cardiovascular testing of sympathetic adrenergic and cholinergic function and cardiovagal cholinergic function was undertaken in 17 children (mean age, 8.6 years) with Hirschsprung disease and 19 age- and sex-matched control children (mean age, 9.9 years). Autonomic dysfunction was found in 7 of 17 patients with Hirschsprung disease. Evidence of sympathetic denervation was found in 3 of the 7 patients; 2 showed a parasympathetic dysfunction, and the remaining 2 had dysfunction of both sympathetic and parasympathetic tests. A RET mutation was found in one of the patients. Lipson (1988) raised the question of hyperthermia in early gestation as a factor in Hirschsprung disease. Larsson et al. (1989) could not confirm a correlation between hyperthermia during pregnancy and Hirschsprung disease in the offspring. Taking advantage of a proximal deletion of chromosome 10q, del10(q11.21q21.2), in a patient with total colonic aganglionosis (Martucciello et al., 1992) and making use of a high-density genetic map of microsatellite DNA markers, Lyonnet et al. (1993) performed genetic linkage analysis in 15 nonsyndromic long-segment and short-segment Hirschsprung disease families. Multipoint linkage analysis indicated that the most likely location for the HSCR locus is between D10S208 and D10S196, suggesting that a dominant gene for this disorder maps to 10q11.2, a region to which other neural crest defects have been mapped. Fewtrell et al. (1994) also found total colonic aganglionosis in association with a 10q deletion: del(10)(q11.2q21.2). Total colonic aganglionosis was described in association with congenital failure of autonomic control of ventilation (Ondine's curse) by O'Dell et al. (1987). Hirschsprung disease has been observed in association with MEN2A (171400; see Verdy et al., 1982) and MEN2B (162300; see Mahaffey et al., 1990). It should be noted that the piebald-lethal mutation in the mouse (locus S), a model of aganglionic megacolon, has been assigned to mouse chromosome 14, whose proximal long arm is homologous to human 10q11-q21. By the molecular characterization of the previously reported familial microdeletion and of 3 additional cytogenetically visible de novo deletions, isolated in somatic cell hybrids, Luo et al. (1993) identified a smallest region of overlap of 250 kb. This contained the RET (164761) gene. Adult HSCR patients with deletions of the RET gene were negative by the pentagastrin test (which detects preclinical forms of MEN2A or MEN2B). Because of the striking phenotypic diversity displayed by alleles at the same locus, such as spinal bulbar muscular atrophy and testicular feminization, due to different mutations in the androgen receptor gene (313700), Luo et al. (1993) considered it plausible that the RET gene is the site of the mutation causing Hirschsprung disease. In 5 HSCR families, Angrist et al. (1993) identified linkage to the pericentromeric region of chromosome 10. A maximum 2-point lod score of 3.37 at theta = 0.045 was observed between HSCR and D10S176, under an incompletely penetrant dominant model. Multipoint, affecteds-only and nonparametric analyses supported this finding and localized the gene to a region of approximately 7 cM, in close proximity to the locus for MEN2. Edery et al. (1994) presented strong evidence that both the short-segment (accounting for 80% of cases of Hirschsprung disease) and long-segment (accounting for 20% of cases) forms of aganglionic megacolon are fundamentally the same disorder due to mutations in the RET gene. Genetic linkage analysis using microsatellite DNA markers of 10q in 11 long-segment families and 8 short-segment families showed tight linkage with no recombination between the disease locus and the RET locus. Thus, the 2 anatomical forms of familial Hirschsprung disease, which have been separated on the basis of clinical criteria, have no fundamental reason to be separated but must be regarded as the variable clinical expression of mutations at the RET locus. Such point mutations had specifically been identified in 6 HSCR families linked to 10q11.2. These mutations resulted in either amino acid substitutions or protein termination. Long-segment and short-segment HSCR occurred in the same family and lack of penetrance was observed. The arg180-to-ter nonsense mutation (164761.0021) was observed in 2 patients with long-segment HSCR and in their unaffected mother in family 3. The pro64-to-leu mutation (164761.0019) was observed in a proband with short-segment HSCR and in 2 persons with severe constipation in family 15. The arg330-to-gln mutation (164761.0022) was found in 1 patient with short-segment HSCR, 1 patient with long-segment HSCR, and in 3 unaffected subjects in family 2. Finally, the ser32-to-leu mutation (164761.0018) was found in a patient with long-segment HSCR, in 2 patients with short-segment HSCR, in a subject with severe constipation, and in an unaffected subject in family 5. Chakravarti (1996) estimated that RET mutations account for approximately 50% of HSCR cases and EDNRB (131244) mutations account for approximately 5%. Short-segment HSCR occurs in about 25% of RET-caused cases and in more than 95% of EDNRB-related cases. Whereas homozygosity for mutations of the EDNRB gene causes deafness and pigmentary anomalies in addition to HSCR (e.g., 131244.0002), the homozygous phenotype for RET has not been observed. Chakravarti (1996) provided a figure showing the distribution of RET mutations causing HSCR; they numbered about 48 and were widely distributed through the gene. Iwashita et al. (1996) introduced 5 HSCR mutations into the extracellular domain of human RET cDNA. These mutations were introduced with or without a MEN2A mutation (cys634arg; 164761.0011). The investigators demonstrated that with the 5 HSCR extracellular domain RET mutations cell surface expression of the protein was low. Iwashita et al. (1996) concluded that sufficient levels of RET expression on the cell surface are required for migration of ganglia toward the distal portion of the colon or for full differentiation. Borrego et al. (1999) studied polymorphic sequence variation in RET in 64 prospectively ascertained individuals with HSCR from the Andalusia region of Spain. For 2 polymorphic variants the rare allele was overrepresented in HSCR cases as compared to controls, while the rare allele for 2 other variants was underrepresented in HSCR cases. Borrego et al. (1999) concluded that RET polymorphisms predispose to HSCR in a complex low-penetrance manner and may modify phenotypic expression. Another possible cause of, or contributing factor to, megacolon in humans was suggested by the results of 'knockout' experiments in mice by Hatano et al. (1997) involving a Hox11 gene: Ncx/Hox11L.1. This gene was inactivated in embryonic stem cells by homologous recombination. The homozygous mutant mice were viable and had no morphologic abnormalities at birth, but developed megacolon with enteric ganglia by age 3 to 5 weeks. Histochemical analysis of the ganglia revealed that the enteric neurons 'hyperinnervated' in the narrow segment of megacolon. Some of these neuronal cells degenerated and neuronal cell death occurred in later stages. Hatano et al. (1997) proposed that Ncx/Hox11L.1 is required for maintenance of proper functions of the enteric nervous system. They pointed out that neuronal intestinal dysplasia is a human congenital disorder that is characterized by megacolon with a normal number of ganglia or hyperplasia of enteric neurons (McMahon et al., 1981; Munakata et al., 1985). Sijmons et al. (1998) investigated the possibility that some patients with Hirschsprung disease and germline mutations in the RET gene may be exposed to an increased risk of tumor formation. Among 60 patients with Hirschsprung disease, the authors found 3 with MEN2A-type RET mutations, 2 with cys620 to arg (164761.0009) and 1 with cys609 to tyr (164761.0029). Two of these patients were children in whom no evidence of MEN2A-related pathology was found. One of these children had inherited her mutation from her mother, who presented with medullary thyroid carcinoma and pheochromocytoma at the age of 28. This child underwent prophylactic thyroidectomy. The adult patient was a 34-year-old woman who had undergone surgery for short-segment Hirschsprung disease at the age of 8 weeks and in whom pentagastrin stimulation had produced grossly abnormal calcitonin levels, raising the possibility of thyroid C-cell pathology. The authors concluded that these cases, together with a small number of others reported in the literature, suggest that screening for RET mutations in patients with familial or sporadic Hirschsprung disease is not recommended outside a complete clinical research setting. They added that if a MEN2A-type RET mutation is found in such a patient, screening for MEN2 tumors should be offered. Borrego et al. (2000) reported that isolated cases of Hirschsprung disease are more likely to have genotypes containing the allelic variant ala45 to ala (A45A; 164761.0038) than controls or unaffected parents. As indicated, mutations in RET (164761), GDNF (600837), EDNRB, EDN3 (131242), and SOX10 (602229) lead to long-segment Hirschsprung disease (L-HSCR) and syndromic HSCR but fail to explain the transmission of the much more common short-segment form (S-HSCR). Bolk Gabriel et al. (2002) conducted a genome scan in families with S-HSCR and identified susceptibility loci at 3p21, 10q11, and 19q12 that seem to be necessary and sufficient to explain recurrence risk and population incidence. The gene at 10q11 was thought to be RET, supporting its crucial role in all forms of HSCR; however, coding sequence mutations in RET were present in only 40% of families linked to 10q11, suggesting the importance of noncoding variation. Bolk Gabriel et al. (2002) showed oligogenic inheritance of S-HSCR with 3p21 and 19q12 loci functioning as RET-dependent modifiers. They also demonstrated a parent-of-origin effect at the RET locus. Of the 49 families they studied, 27 shared 1 allele identical by descent (IBD) at the RET locus; although the shared allele was expected to be equally transmitted by either parent, they observed, instead, 21 maternal and 6 paternal transmissions. This effect was not gender-specific but a true parent-of-origin effect, as, within the 27 nuclear families with 1 allele IBD, there were 29 affected males and 25 affected females. No similar parent-of-origin effect was observed at the 3p21 and 19q12 loci. Using gene expression profiling, Iwashita et al. (2003) determined that genes associated with Hirschsprung disease were highly upregulated in rat gut neural crest stem cells relative to whole-fetus RNA. Among the genes with highest expression were GDNF, SOX10, GFRA1 (601496), and EDNRB. The highest expression was seen in RET, which was found to be necessary for neural crest stem cell migration in the gut. GDNF promoted the migration of neural crest stem cells in culture but did not affect their survival or proliferation. The observations made by Iwashita et al. (2003) were confirmed by quantitative RT-PCR, flow cytometry, and functional analysis. Burzynski et al. (2004) typed 13 markers within and flanking the RET gene in 117 Dutch patients with sporadic HSCR, 64 of whom had been screened for RET mutations and found negative, and their parents. There was a strong association between 6 markers in the 5-prime region of RET and HSCR, with significant transmission distortion of those markers. Homozygotes for this 6-marker haplotype had a highly increased risk of developing HSCR (OR greater than 20). Burzynski et al. (2004) concluded that RET may play a crucial role in HSCR even when no RET mutations are found, and that disease-associated variants are likely to be located between the promoter region and exon 2 of the RET gene. Emison et al. (2005) used family-based association studies to identify a disease interval, and integrated this with comparative and functional genomic analysis to prioritize conserved and functional elements within which mutations in RET can be sought. Emison et al. (2005) showed that a common noncoding RET variant within a conserved enhancer-like sequence in intron 1 (164761.0050) is significantly associated with HSCR susceptibility and makes a 20-fold greater contribution to risk than rare alleles do. This mutation reduces in vitro enhancer activity markedly, has low penetrance, and has different genetic effects in males and females, and explains several features of the complex inheritance pattern of HSCR. Thus, Emison et al. (2005) concluded that common low-penetrance variants identified by association studies can underlie both common and rare diseases. Emison et al. (2005) concluded that RET mutations, coding and/or noncoding, are probably a necessary feature in all cases of HSCR. However, RET mutations are not sufficient for HSCR because disease incidence also requires mutations at additional loci. GENOTYPE/PHENOTYPE CORRELATIONS Kashuk et al. (2005) reported the alignment of the human RET protein sequence with the orthologous sequences of 12 nonhuman vertebrates, their comparative analysis, the evolutionary topology of the RET protein, and predicted tolerance for all published missense mutations. NOMENCLATURE Tentatively, the RET-dependent modifier loci for short-segment Hirschsprung disease located on 3p21 and 19q12 are designated here Hirschsprung disease, short-segment, 2 (HSCRS2; 606874) and Hirschsprung disease, short-segment, 3 (HSCRS3; 606875), respectively. HISTORY Passarge (1993) stated that Harald Hirschsprung (1830-1916) was a Danish physician in Copenhagen and that his family lent its name to the Hirschsprung Art Gallery of Copenhagen.

comment: A number sign (#) is used with this entry because of evidence that holoprosencephaly-3 is caused by mutation in the gene encoding the human sonic hedgehog homolog (SHH; 600725). For a phenotypic description and a discussion of genetic heterogeneity of holoprosencephaly, see HPE1 (236100). Lurie et al. (1990) pointed out that at least 9 cases of HPE have occurred in patients with confirmed loss of 7q34-q36. They reported balanced rearrangements involving 7q in 2 mothers examined after the birth of their nonkaryotyped infants with HPE and hydronephrosis. They suggested that in both infants del(7q) was the most probable cause of HPE. Cyclopia and cebocephaly were conspicuous features in the cases of del(7q). Sporadic cases of cyclopia have been observed in association with trisomy 13, ring 13, and other chromosomal abnormalities and many have had normal karyotypes. Masuno and Orii (1990) also pointed to reports of holoprosencephaly in association with terminal 7q deletion. Kleczkowska et al. (1990) described the case of a female fetus with hemilobar holoprosencephaly and 46,XX,der(7)t(7;8)(q36.1;p12)mat karyotype. The holoprosencephaly sequence was considered to be related to the distal 7(q36.1-qter) deficiency. Hatziioannou et al. (1991) reviewed the evidence suggesting that a locus for holoprosencephaly resides at or near 7q36. Gurrieri et al. (1993) characterized the 7q deletions in 13 HPE patients and constructed a high resolution physical map of 7q32-qter. As a first step toward cloning an HPE gene crucial for normal brain development, they defined the HPE minimal critical region in 7q36 between D7S292 and D7S392. They pictured one of the patients with the characteristic facies of the severe form of HPE which included a single fused eye (cyclopia) and a nose-like structure (proboscis) above the eye. Midline structures of the forebrain were absent, consistent with alobar HPE. Muenke et al. (1993) performed linkage studies in 10 families with autosomal dominant HPE. The phenotypic features in affected individuals varied from the most severe forms with single brain ventricle and cyclopia to milder forms with ocular hypotelorism and midface hypoplasia to clinically unaffected carriers. Under the most conservative model-free analysis, linkage between HPE and D7S22 showed a combined lod score of 7.2 at theta = 0.0, with 1 family independently presenting a lod score of 3.0 at theta = 0.0. Muenke et al. (1993) concluded that autosomal dominant HPE is at the locus that has been designated HPE3 and mapped to 7q36. Muenke et al. (1994) suggested that mutations in the HPE3 gene are responsible for both sporadic HPE and a majority of families with autosomal dominant HPE. Clinical evaluation of the affected individuals in the 9 families in the report of Muenke et al. (1994) confirmed the previously reported phenotypic variability of autosomal dominant HPE. In each family, one or more obligate gene carriers had classic (alobar, semilobar, or lobar) HPE, many of whom died during early infancy. Others had HPE microforms such as microcephaly, mental retardation, microphthalmia, ocular coloboma, ocular hypotelorism, midface hypoplasia, single central upper incisor, cleft lip, and cleft lip and palate. Some obligate gene carriers had normal phenotypes, including normal intellect. In 1 of the 9 families, linkage to D7S22 and other markers on chromosome 7q was excluded, thus indicating genetic heterogeneity. The clinical manifestations, including the HPE microforms, did not differ between individuals in the unlinked kindred and those in the other 8 kindreds linked to 7q36. Belloni et al. (1996) refined the position of the HPE3 locus by detailed characterization of HPE3 patients with rearrangements involving chromosome 7q36. They also established a contig of genomic clones in this region. Belloni et al. (1996) demonstrated that a cDNA for SHH, the human sonic hedgehog homolog, showed specific hybridization to the contig which spanned the translocation breakpoint. Further analysis revealed that SHH mapped approximately 250 and 15 kb centromeric of T1 and T2, respectively (T1 and T2 represent the translocation breakpoints in 2 unrelated patients with a mild form of HPE3). Belloni et al. (1996) proposed that the chromosomal rearrangements remove distal cis-acting regulatory elements or exert long-range position effects causing aberrant expression of the gene. They noted that HPE patients exhibiting deletions of the SHH region are generally more severely affected than are the translocation patients. The mild HPE phenotype displayed by the patient with the T2 balanced translocation included premaxillary aplasia with midline cleft lip, hypotelorism, sensorineural hearing loss, lack of tooth eruption, and cervical cord compression due to stenosis. Benzacken et al. (1997) reported 4 new cases of holoprosencephaly in fetuses with abnormal karyotypes. Three of these had terminal deletions of 7q, confirming the importance of 7q36 in holoprosencephaly. The fourth fetus had an apparently balanced de novo translocation, t(7;13)(q21.2;q33), without any visible loss of the distal part of chromosome 7q. Benzacken et al. (1997) proposed either a long range positional effect or the existence of genes involved in prosencephalon development at 7q21.2 or 13q33 as an explanation for this. Roessler et al. (1996) identified SHH as the gene responsible for HPE3. They analyzed 30 autosomal dominant HPE families and found 5 families that segregated different heterozygous SHH mutations. Two of these mutations predict premature termination of SHH protein (600725.0002 and 600725.0003). The remaining 3 mutations altered highly conserved residues in the vicinity of the alpha helix-1 motif (600725.0004 and 600725.0005) or the signal cleavage site (600725.0001). Roessler et al. (1996) noted that in humans loss of one SHH allele is sufficient to cause HPE, whereas in the mouse both alleles need to be lost to produce a similar CNS phenotype. They observed that haploinsufficiency for SHH in human is sufficient to disturb ventral midline neurogenesis but is insufficient to cause ventralization defects of sclerotome or limb abnormalities. Odent et al. (1998) reviewed 258 HPE records involving at least 1 affected child and found 97 cases in 79 families with nonsyndromic, nonchromosomal HPE. A high degree of familial aggregation was found in 29% of families. By segregation analysis, Odent et al. (1998) concluded that autosomal dominant inheritance with incomplete penetrance (82% for major and 88% for major and minor) was the most likely mode of inheritance. Sporadic cases accounted for 68%, and the recurrence risk after an isolated case was predicted to be 13 to 14%. Nanni et al. (1999) presented a panel of 12 photographs illustrating the range of severity in holoprosencephaly resulting from mutation in the SHH gene. Nowaczyk et al. (2000) reported an infant with holoprosencephaly, sacral anomalies, and situs ambiguus associated with partial monosomy 7q/trisomy 2p, der(7)t(2;7)(p23.2;q36.1), as a result of an adjacent-1 segregation of a t(2;7) in the father. The chromosomal abnormality was diagnosed prenatally after sonographic detection of HPE in the fetus. The baby was born at 37 weeks' gestation and died in the neonatal period; he had dysmorphic features consistent with the HPE sequence. Postmortem examination showed semilobar HPE, abdominal situs ambiguus, multiple segments of bowel atresia, dilatation of the ureters, and bony sacral anomalies. Molecular analysis confirmed hemizygosity for the SHH and HLXB9 (142994) genes, which were thought to be responsible for the HPE and sacral phenotypes, respectively. Immunohistochemical studies showed intact dopaminergic pathways in the mesencephalon, suggesting that midbrain dopamine neuron induction requires only one functioning SHH allele. In familial holoprosencephaly pedigrees, Suthers et al. (1999) reported a skewed sex ratio among transmitting parents with SHH gene mutations, 14 of 16 being mothers (p = 0.002). Suthers et al. (1999) also found that of 16 reported cases of single maxillary central incisor with no other congenital malformation, 13 were female (p = 0.0085). Suthers et al. (1999) concluded that boys with SHH gene mutations may be at greater risk of major malformations outside the central nervous system, thus reducing their reproductive fitness, explaining the observed skewed sex ratio. Marini et al. (2003) studied a family, previously described by Camera et al. (1992), in which the mother presented with a single central maxillary incisor and mild hypotelorism and her daughter and 2 fetuses were diagnosed with HPE. Sequencing of DNA in this family identified a nonsense mutation in the SHH gene (600725.0019).

comment: A number sign (#) is used with this entry because of evidence that holoprosencephaly-4 is caused by mutations in the TGIF gene (602630). For phenotypic information and a general discussion of genetic heterogeneity in holoprosencephaly, see HPE1 (236100). This form of holoprosencephaly was described in association with an interstitial deletion of q11.1-q13 of chromosome 14 by Levin and Surana (1991). Parental karyotypes were normal. The white female, born to nonconsanguineous young parents after an uncomplicated pregnancy, showed hypotelorism, lack of nasal bridge, flattened nasal tip with no visible septum, wide midline cleft of lip and hard palate, and ptosis of the left upper eyelid. Axial CT scan of the head was interpreted as showing semilobar holoprosencephaly. The infant died at 8 days. Johnson and Bachman (1976) described a normal female who appeared to have a nonreciprocal translocation from the short arm of one chromosome 18 to the long arm of a chromosome 12. She gave birth to a cebocephalic child whose karyotype included an 18p- chromosome. The association of loss of 18p with holoprosencephaly was suggested by the patient reported by Munke et al. (1988); cytogenetic and molecular studies indicated a Y/18 translocation with loss of 18p and distal Yq material in a holoprosencephalic fetus. As a first step toward positional cloning of the HPE4 gene, Overhauser et al. (1995) narrowed the assignment of the gene to 18p by characterizing the 18p deletions and clinical features of 6 patients by using a combination of somatic cell hybrid analysis and fluorescence in situ hybridization. By using a set of 27 chromosome 18p-specific markers, the deletion in each patient was characterized. The HPE minimal critical region was defined as 18p11.3. They pictured one of their patients with ocular hypotelorism, microcephaly, and a single central maxillary incisor (147250). Nanni et al. (1999) described 2 families with mutations in the Sonic hedgehog gene (SHH; 600725), which is mutant in HPE3 (142945), who also had mutations in the TGIF gene. They suggested that such combinations of mutations may account for the intrafamilial variability frequently observed in holoprosencephaly. By FISH analysis, Gripp et al. (2000) demonstrated that the TGIF gene resides within the HPE4 minimal critical region. Mutation analysis of the TGIF gene in 268 DNA samples of patients with HPE detected 4 heterozygous missense mutations in the coding region, 1 of which was identified in familial HPE and 3 of which were identified in clinically sporadic cases. Odent et al. (1998) reviewed 258 HPE records involving at least 1 affected child and found 97 cases in 79 families with nonsyndromic, nonchromosomal HPE. A high degree of familial aggregation was found in 29% of families. By segregation analysis, Odent et al. (1998) concluded that autosomal dominant inheritance with incomplete penetrance (82% for major and 88% for major and minor) was the most likely mode of inheritance. Sporadic cases accounted for 68%, and the recurrence risk after an isolated case was predicted to be 13 to 14%.

comment: A number sign (#) is used with this entry because of evidence that isolated median maxillary central incisor can be caused by a mutation in the Sonic hedgehog gene (SHH; 600725). Rappaport et al. (1976, 1977) reported 7 unrelated patients with single (unpaired) deciduous and permanent maxillary central incisors and short stature. Five of them had isolated growth hormone deficiency. The other 2 had normal growth hormone responses but were short of stature. No similar or possibly related abnormalities were present in the 7 families. Fused central incisors is a feature of the 18p- phenotype. Dolan et al. (1981) and Aughton et al. (1991) reported cases of del(18p) syndrome and single maxillary central incisor. Hattori et al. (1987) described holoprosencephaly (236100) in a child born to a mother with single central maxillary incisor. The infant had a median cleft lip, flat nose with a single nostril, hypotelorism, and normal chromosomes. CT scan of the brain showed semilobar holoprosencephaly. The mother had mild hypotelorism but no anosmia, and her brain CT was normal. She was of normal intelligence and stature. Other relatives did not have single central maxillary incisors, hypotelorism, or oral clefts. Berry et al. (1984) described a single upper central incisor associated with holoprosencephaly in a semidominant pedigree. Winter et al. (1982) found a single central upper incisor in association with precocious puberty and hypothalamic hamartoma. Winter et al. (1988) and Buntinx and Baraitser (1989) described a single central maxillary incisor in patients with a form of ectodermal dysplasia. Artman and Boyden (1990) described a patient with microphthalmia and isolated growth hormone deficiency in association with single central incisor. Liberfarb et al. (1987) described a patient with ocular coloboma associated with a single central incisor and growth failure. The mother had hyposmia, leading the authors to suggest that the case represented an autosomal dominant form of holoprosencephaly (157170). Masuno et al. (1990) described 2 unrelated cases of single maxillary central incisor with 7q terminal deletion. They had mental retardation, microcephaly, hypotelorism, short stature, and normal levels of plasma growth hormone. One patient had bilateral caudal ectopic kidneys, double renal pelves, and dilated ureters. The other had bilateral hydroureteronephrosis. Masuno et al. (1990) suggested that 7q terminal deletion is one of the causes of SMCI. Hall et al. (1997) described a series of 21 consecutive cases of solitary median maxillary central incisor (SMMCI) syndrome seen in the Royal Children's Hospital in Melbourne, Australia, from 1966 to 1997. The spectrum of anomalies and associated features present in these cases, including short stature, choanal atresia, midnasal stenosis, and holoprosencephaly, was described. They pointed out that SMMCI syndrome, previously considered a simple midline defect of the dental lamina, is a possible predictor of holoprosencephalies of varying degree in the proband, members of the proband's family, and in the family's descendents. Hall et al. (1997) commented that it was not surprising that the association of a solitary incisor with the midline nasal cavity defects of choanal atresia, midnasal stenosis, and nasal pyriform aperture stenosis was not noted earlier, because these potentially life-threatening neonatal causes of airway obstruction are managed surgically in the immediate neonatal period, months before the eruption of the maxillary incisor tooth during the second half of the first year of life. Arlis and Ward (1992) recognized the association of solitary central incisor with nasal obstruction. Hall et al. (1997) stated that the presence of a solitary symmetrical maxillary central incisor of normal crown dimensions situated precisely in the midline in both primary and permanent dentitions was apparently first reported by Scott (1958). Rappaport et al. (1976) described the frequent association of short stature and solitary incisor and named the condition monosuperoincisivodontic dwarfism. Nanni et al. (2001) performed a molecular study of 13 patients with solitary median maxillary central incisor (SMMCI) who did not have holoprosencephaly. They studied 2 genes, SHH (600725) and SIX3 (603714), in which mutations had been reported in patients showing SMMCI as part of the holoprosencephaly spectrum. They found a new missense mutation in SHH (I111F; 600725.0014) which may be specific for the SMMCI phenotype since it had not been found in patients with holoprosencephaly or in normal controls. Nanni et al. (2001) reviewed the extensive number of anomalies in addition to holoprosencephaly with which solitary median maxillary central incisor had been reported. Marini et al. (2003) studied a family, previously described by Camera et al. (1992), in which the mother presented with a single central maxillary incisor and mild hypotelorism and her daughter and 2 fetuses were diagnosed with HPE. Sequencing of DNA in this family identified a nonsense mutation in the SHH gene (600725.0019).

comment: CLONING Tavernier et al. (1991) isolated cDNA clones encoding 2 receptor proteins involved in the binding of human interleukin-5 (IL5; 147850). The major transcript of this receptor gene, as analyzed in both eosinophilic sublines of human promyelocytic cells and in eosinophilic myelocytes grown from cord blood, encodes a secreted form of this receptor. A second component of the receptor was found to be identical to the beta chain of the human granulocyte-macrophage colony-stimulating factor high affinity receptor (CSF2RB; 138981). The finding that IL5 and CSF2 share a receptor subunit provides a molecular basis for the observation that these cytokines can partially interfere with each other's binding and have highly overlapping biologic activities on eosinophils. The common use of the same receptor component is reminiscent of the structural relatedness of IL3 (147740), IL5, and GM-CSF (CSF2; 138960). The homology at the C terminus may indicate a related binding domain. The common origin of all 3 cytokines is also suggested by their clustered chromosomal localization and by the structure of their genes. The 60-kD alpha chain binds IL5; the 130-kD beta chain increases the binding affinity but cannot bind IL5 by itself. In addition, the beta chain is required for signal transduction, most likely by association with other receptor components. Tavernier et al. (1992) demonstrated that soluble isoforms of the alpha subunit result from a 'normal' splicing event or from the absence of splicing, whereas synthesis of membrane-anchored forms of the alpha subunit requires alternative splicing. GENE FUNCTION Using a yeast 2-hybrid screen of a granulocyte cDNA library with the cytoplasmic domain of IL5RA as bait, Geijsen et al. (2001) identified an interaction of IL5RA with syntenin (SDCBP; 602217). GST pull-down, BIAcore, coimmunoprecipitation, and deletion mutant analyses confirmed an association of syntenin with the last 15 C-terminal residues of IL5RA; syntenin did not interact with CFS2RB. Within this 15-residue stretch of IL5RA, the C-terminal phenylalanine is critical. Deletion of either of the 2 tandem PDZ domains of syntenin, which are known to interact with C-terminal peptide sequences, abrogated the IL5RA-syntenin interaction. A second 2-hybrid screen identified the mouse transcriptional factor Sox4 (184430) as a binding partner for syntenin but not for IL5RA. The syntenin-Sox4 interaction occurs outside of the PDZ domains of syntenin. Luciferase reporter analysis and fluorescence microscopy showed that IL5, but not IL3, induces cytoplasmic and nuclear expression of syntenin and, in a syntenin- and cytoplasmic IL5RA-dependent manner, of Sox4. Geijsen et al. (2001) concluded that syntenin acts as an adaptor molecule in the IL5RA-mediated activation of SOX4. They also noted that mice lacking either Il5ra or Sox4 have defects in B-cell development. GENE STRUCTURE Sun et al. (1995) identified a promoter (P1) located 5-prime upstream of exon 1 of the IL5RA gene. Zhang et al. (1997) showed that an additional promoter (P2) was present in the 5-prime upstream region of exon 2 of the IL5RA gene. MAPPING By use of recombinant inbred strains of mice, Gough and Rakar (1992) localized the murine equivalent of the IL5R gene to the distal half of chromosome 6. The position lay between 2 regions of conserved synteny, one on human chromosome 2 and the second on human chromosome 3. The human IL5R gene presumably maps to one of these 2 chromosomes. Isobe et al. (1992) mapped the IL5RA gene to 3p26-p24 by Southern blot analysis of DNA from a panel of mouse-human hybrid somatic cell lines complemented by in situ hybridization. Jacob et al. (1993) assigned the IL5R gene to 3p26-p25 by study of human-rodent somatic cell hybrids containing various portions of human chromosome 3 and using a human-specific IL5R tandem repeat marker. Using the mouse-specific tandem repeat marker in recombinant inbred strains of mice, they assigned the Il5r gene to the distal part of mouse chromosome 6, close to the Raf1 locus.

comment: A number sign (#) is used with this entry because medulloblastoma has been found to be caused by mutations in several genes including PTCH2 (603673), APC (175100), beta-catenin (CTNNB1; 116806), SUFU (607035), BRCA2 (600185), and others. A locus for medulloblastoma may map to chromosome 17p. Isochromosome 17q has been observed in high frequency in cytogenetic studies of medulloblastoma, the most common posterior fossa neoplasm in children. By studies using restriction fragment length polymorphisms, Cogen et al. (1990) showed loss of heterozygosity for 17p sequences in 45% of medulloblastomas. The finding was predictive of a poor clinical response to treatment. Furthermore, a deletion could be mapped to 17p13.1-p12, the same chromosomal region for which loss of alleles has been shown in tumor specimens from patients with colon cancer, and the same region to which the p53 gene (191170) has been mapped. However, using denaturing gradient gel electrophoresis and direct sequencing, Cogen et al. (1992) detected p53 mutations in only 2 of 20 medulloblastoma specimens. Moreover, additional RFLP studies of these 20 specimens showed loss of heterozygosity at a more distal and distinct site, 17p13.3. Cerebellar medulloblastoma is a feature of the basal cell nevus syndrome (109400), the von Hippel-Lindau syndrome (193300), and the form of Turcot syndrome (276300) due to mutations in the APC gene (e.g., 175100.0022). In a formal risk analysis for brain tumors in familial adenomatous polyposis, Hamilton et al. (1995) found that the relative risk of cerebellar medulloblastoma in patients with familial adenomatous polyposis was 92 times that for the general population (95% confidence interval, 29 to 269; P less than 0.001). See the DMBT1 gene (601969), so named for 'deleted in malignant brain tumors,' which Mollenhauer et al. (1997) found to be the site of homozygous intragenic deletions at chromosome 10q25.3-q26.1 in medulloblastoma and glioblastoma multiforme tumor tissue, as well as in brain tumor cell lines. Studying the molecular basis for metastasis in medulloblastoma, MacDonald et al. (2001) obtained expression profiles of 23 primary medulloblastomas clinically designated as either metastatic (M+) or nonmetastatic (M0) and identified 85 genes whose expression differed significantly between classes. They found that platelet-derived growth factor receptor-alpha (PDGFRA; 173490) and members of the downstream Ras/mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) signal transduction pathway are upregulated in M+ tumors. Immunohistochemical validation on an independent set of tumors showed significant overexpression of PDGFRA in M+ tumors compared to M0 tumors. Using in vitro assays, they showed that platelet-derived growth factor-alpha (PDGFA; 173430) enhances medulloblastoma migration and increases phosphorylation of downstream MAP2K1 (176872), MAP2K2 (601263), MAPK1 (176948), and MAPK3 (601795) in a dose-dependent manner. MacDonald et al. (2001) suggested that inhibitors of PDGFRA and RAS proteins should be considered as possible novel therapeutic strategies against medulloblastoma. Gilbertson and Clifford (2003) stated that the oligonucleotide probe used by MacDonald et al. (2001) to determine PDGFRA expression actually identified PDGFRB (173410), and therefore called into question whether PDGFRA or PDGFRB is regulated in invasive forms of medulloblastoma. Gilbertson and Clifford (2003) presented data confirming that PDGFRB is preferentially expressed in metastatic medulloblastoma and suggested that it may prove useful as a prognostic marker and as a therapeutic target for the disease. Pomeroy et al. (2002) approached the problems of CNS tumor classification by developing a system based on DNA microarray gene expression data derived from 99 patient samples. They demonstrated that medulloblastomas are molecularly distinct from other brain tumors including primitive neuroectodermal tumors (PNETs), atypical teratoid/rhabdoid tumors (609322), and malignant gliomas. They also found evidence supporting the derivation of medulloblastomas from cerebellar granule cells through activation of the Sonic hedgehog pathway (see 600725). Pomeroy et al. (2002) further showed that the clinical outcome of children with medulloblastomas is highly predictable on the basis of the gene expression profiles of their tumors at diagnosis. Malignant gliomas were clearly separable from medulloblastomas in that they express genes typical of the astrocytic and oligodendrocytic lineage. Medulloblastomas express ZIC (600470) and NSCL1 (162360), encoding transcription factors that are specific for cerebellar granule cells. This result suggested to Pomeroy et al. (2002) that medulloblastomas, but not PNETs, arise from cerebellar granule cells, or alternatively, have activated the transcriptional program of cerebellar granule cells. Desmoplastic tumors make up about 20 to 30% of medulloblastomas, have a more nodular architecture than 'classical' medulloblastoma, and may have a better prognosis. Activation of the Sonic hedgehog (SHH) signaling pathway is particularly high in desmoplastic medulloblastomas, as shown by increased expression of the SHH target genes GLI (165220), SMOH (601500), and PTCH. Taylor et al. (2002) found that SUFU (607035) also functions as a tumor suppressor gene in a subset of desmoplastic medulloblastomas. Hallahan et al. (2003) established that retinoids cause extensive apoptosis of medulloblastoma cells. In a xenograft model, retinoids largely abrogated tumor growth. Using receptor-specific retinoid agonists, Hallahan et al. (2003) defined a subset of mRNAs that were induced by all active retinoids in retinoid-sensitive cell lines. They also identified BMP2 (112261) as a candidate mediator of retinoid activity. BMP2 protein induced medulloblastoma cell apoptosis, whereas the BMP2 antagonist Noggin (602991) blocked both retinoid and BMP2-induced apoptosis. BMP2 also induced p38 MAPK (600289), which is necessary for BMP2- and retinoid-induced apoptosis. Retinoid-resistant medulloblastoma cells underwent apoptosis when treated with BMP2 or when cultured with retinoid-sensitive medulloblastoma cells. Retinoid-induced expression of BMP2 is thus necessary and sufficient for apoptosis of retinoid-responsive cells, and expression of BMP2 by retinoid-sensitive cells is sufficient to induce apoptosis in surrounding retinoid-resistant cells. Leung et al. (2004) demonstrated that BMI1 (164831) is strongly expressed in proliferating cerebellar precursor cells in mice and humans. Using Bmi1 null mice, Leung et al. (2004) demonstrated a crucial role for BMI1 in clonal expansion of granule cell precursors both in vivo and in vitro. Deregulated proliferation of these progenitor cells, by activation of the Shh pathway, leads to medulloblastoma development. Leung et al. (2004) also demonstrated linked overexpression of BMI1 and patched (601309), suggestive of SHH pathway activation, in a substantial fraction of primary human medulloblastomas. Together with the rapid induction of Bmi1 expression on addition of Shh or on overexpression of the Shh target Gli1 in cerebellar granule cell cultures, Leung et al. (2004) concluded that their findings implicate BMI1 overexpression as an alternative or additive mechanism in the pathogenesis of medulloblastomas, and highlight a role for BMI1-containing polycomb complexes in proliferation of cerebellar precursor cells. In 2 brothers who both developed Wilms tumor (194070) and brain tumors, Reid et al. (2005) identified 2 truncating BRCA2 mutations (600185.0027; 600185.0031). One boy had recurrent medulloblastoma. ANIMAL MODEL Marino et al. (2000) generated a mouse model for medulloblastoma by Cre-LoxP-mediated inactivation of Rb (RB1; 180200) and p53 tumor suppressor genes in the cerebellar external granular layer (EGL) cells. Recombination mediated by Gfap (137780) promoter-driven Cre was found both in astrocytes and in immature precursor cells of the EGL in the developing cerebellum. Gfap-Cre-mediated inactivation of Rb in a p53-null background produced mice that developed highly aggressive embryonal tumors of the cerebellum with typical features of medulloblastoma. These tumors were identified as early as 7 weeks of age on the outer surface of the molecular layer, corresponding to the location of the EGL cells during development. Marino et al. (2000) concluded that loss of function of Rb is essential for medulloblastoma development in the mouse and stated that their results strongly support the hypothesis that medulloblastomas arise from multipotent precursor cells located in the EGL. Berman et al. (2002) investigated the therapeutic efficacy of the hedgehog pathway antagonist cyclopamine in preclinical models of medulloblastoma, the most common malignant brain tumor in children. Cyclopamine treatment of murine medulloblastoma cells blocked proliferation in vitro and induced changes in gene expression consistent with initiation of neuronal differentiation and loss of neuronal stem cell-like character. The compound also caused regression of murine tumor allografts in vivo and induced rapid death of cells from freshly resected human medulloblastomas, but not from other brain tumors, and thus established a specific role for hedgehog pathway activity in medulloblastoma growth.

comment: DESCRIPTION MITF is a basic helix-loop-helix (hHLH)-leucine zipper protein that plays a role in the development of various cell types, including neural crest-derived melanocytes and optic cup-derived retinal pigment epithelial cells (Fuse et al., 1999). CLONING The mouse 'microphthalmia' (mi) gene encodes a bHLH zipper protein that functions as a homodimeric transcription factor. Mutations in mi lead to loss of pigmentation in the eye, inner ear, and skin, and to reduced eye size and early-onset deafness. Mice with mi mutations serve as models for human pigment disturbances in skin and eye that may be combined with sensorineural deafness. Tachibana et al. (1994) obtained cDNA and genomic clones of the human homolog of mouse mi, MITF, and identified a restriction fragment length polymorphism in the gene. The deduced mouse and human MITF proteins share 94.3% amino acid identity. Both proteins contain 419 amino acids and have central bHLH domains. Fuse et al. (1999) noted that 3 different MITF splice variants, MITF-A, MITF-M, and MITF-H, had been identified. The variants differ in their 5-prime ends and encode proteins with different N termini. The deduced MITF-A, MITF-H, and MITF-M proteins have calculated molecular masses of 58.2, 56.4, and 46.9 kD, respectively. All MITF isoforms have a central transcriptional activation domain, followed by a bHLH-leucine zipper region and a C-terminal serine-rich region. MITF-M differs from the other isoforms in that it has a 6-amino acid insertion prior to the basic region. Fuse et al. (1999) cloned a novel MITF splice variant, MITF-C, by PCR and 5-prime RACE of a kidney cDNA library. The deduced MITF-C protein contains 519 amino acids and has a calculated molecular mass of 58.0 kD. Like the other MITF isoforms, MITF-C has a unique N terminus, and it does not have the 6-amino acid insertion found in MITF-M. RT-PCR detected coexpression of MITF-A and MITF-H in all human cell lines examined and in kidney, whereas MITF-M was detected only in melanoma cell lines. MITF-C was expressed in many cell lines, but not in melanomas. Western blot analysis of HeLa cells transfected with these 4 MITF variants revealed proteins that migrated at apparent molecular masses higher than their calculated molecular masses. Udono et al. (2000) identified a novel MITF splice variant, MITF-B, that encodes a 495-amino acid protein with a calculated molecular mass of 55.4 kD. RT-PCR detected MITF-B expression in all cell types examined. GENE FUNCTION As mice with mutations at mi alleles and humans with WS2 lack melanocytes in affected tissues, Tachibana et al. (1996) speculated that MITF may be involved in mediating melanocyte differentiation by functioning as a transcription factor. In support of this idea, they demonstrated that NIH 3T3 cells transfected with MITF developed melanocytic phenotypes. MITF transfectants formed foci of morphologically altered cells, which resembled those induced by oncogenes, but did not exhibit malignant phenotypes. Instead, they contained dendritic cells that expressed melanogenic marker proteins such as tyrosinase and tyrosinase-related protein-1 (TYRP1; 115501). Such properties were not observed in cells transfected with the closely related TFE3 cDNA. Mutations in MITF and PAX3, encoding transcription factors, are responsible for Waardenburg syndrome type II and WS1/WS3 (193500, 148820), respectively. Tachibana et al. (1996) showed that MITF transactivates the gene for tyrosinase (see 606933), a key enzyme for melanogenesis, and is critically involved in melanocyte differentiation. Absence of melanocytes affects pigmentation in the skin, hair, and eyes, and hearing function in the cochlea. Therefore, hypopigmentation and hearing loss in WS2 are likely to be the results of an anomaly of melanocyte differentiation caused by MITF mutations. However, the molecular mechanism by which PAX3 mutations cause the auditory-pigmentary symptoms in WS1/WS3 had not been explained. Watanabe et al. (1998) showed that PAX3, a transcription factor with a paired domain and a homeodomain, transactivates the MITF promoter. They further showed that PAX3 proteins associated with WS1 in either the paired domain or the homeodomain failed to recognize and transactivate the MITF promoter. These results provided evidence that PAX3 directly regulates MITF, and suggested that the failure of this regulation due to PAX3 mutations causes the auditory-pigmentary symptoms in at least some individuals with WS1. In mouse follicular melanocytes, production of eumelanins and pheomelanins is under the control of 2 intercellular signaling molecules that exert opposite actions: alpha-MSH (see 176830), which preferentially increases the synthesis of eumelanins, and agouti signal protein (ASP; 600201), whose expression favors the production of hair containing pheomelanins. Aberdam et al. (1998) reported that ASP not only affects mature melanocytes but can also inhibit the differentiation of melanoblasts. They showed that both alpha-MSH and forskolin promote the differentiation of murine melanoblasts into mature melanocytes, and that ASP inhibits this process. Expression of MITF and its binding to an M-box regulatory element is inhibited by ASP. Aberdam et al. (1998) also showed that in a murine melanoma cell line, ASP inhibits alpha-MSH-stimulated expression of tyrosinase (see 606933), TYRP1, and TYRP2 (DCT; 191275) through an inhibition of the transcriptional activity of their respective promoters. Further, ASP inhibits alpha-MSH-induced expression of the MITF gene and reduces the level of MITF in the cells. Aberdam et al. (1998) concluded that ASP can regulate both melanoblast differentiation and melanogenesis, pointing out the key role of MITF in the control of these processes. Fuse et al. (1999) found that MITF-A, MITF-H, MITF-M, and MITF-C transactivated a tyrosinase test promoter in transfected HeLa cells. All tested isoforms, except MITF-C, also weakly transactivated a heme oxygenase-1 (HMOX1; 141250) test promoter. Udono et al. (2000) showed that MITF-B transactivated the tyrosinase, TYRP1, and TYRP2 promoters. The ability of MITF-A, MITF-H, and MITF-M to transactivate promoter activity varied depending on the cell types assayed. Takeda et al. (2000) demonstrated that serine at codon 298 plays an important role in MITF function. Glycogen synthase kinase-3B (GSK3B; 605004) was found to phosphorylate serine-298 in vitro, thereby enhancing the binding of MITF to the tyrosinase promoter. Serine-298 was also phosphorylated in vivo, and expression of dominant-negative GSK3-beta selectively suppressed the ability of MITF to transactivate the tyrosinase promoter. Khaled et al. (2002) found that GSK3B synergized with MITF in mouse melanoma cells to activate the tyrosinase promoter. Lithium, a GSK3B inhibitor, impaired the response of the tyrosinase promoter to cAMP, and cAMP increased binding of MITF to the M-box regulatory element. Khaled et al. (2002) concluded that activation of GSK3B by cAMP facilitates MITF binding to the tyrosinase promoter, stimulating melanogenesis. Bondurand et al. (2000) showed that SOX10 (602229), in synergy with PAX3, strongly activates MITF expression in transfection assays. Transfection experiments revealed that PAX3 and SOX10 interact directly by binding to a proximal region of the MITF promoter containing binding sites for both factors. Mutant SOX10 or PAX3 proteins failed to transactivate this promoter, providing further evidence that the 2 genes act in concert to directly regulate expression of MITF. In situ hybridization experiments carried out in the dominant megacolon (Dom) mouse confirmed that SOX10 dysfunction impaired Mitf expression as well as melanocytic development and survival. The authors hypothesized that interaction between 3 of the genes that are altered in WS could explain the auditory/pigmentary symptoms of this disease. The SOX10 and PAX3 transcription factors can directly regulate both MITF and RET in a synergistic fashion. Lang and Epstein (2003) showed that PAX3 and SOX10 can physically interact; this interaction contributes to synergistic activation of a conserved RET enhancer, and it explains why SOX10 mutants that cannot bind DNA still retain the ability to activate this enhancer in the presence of PAX3. However, in the context of the MITF gene, PAX3 and SOX10 must each bind independently to DNA in order to achieve synergy. These observations appear to explain the phenotype in the mild form of Yemenite deaf-blind syndrome (601706) caused by a specific SOX10 mutation (602229.0005) in the HMG box that abrogates DNA binding without disrupting association with PAX3. There is a phenotypic similarity between microphthalmia Mitf mi/mi mutant mice and cathepsin K (601105)-null mice as well as the human disease pycnodysostosis (265800) caused by cathepsin K deficiency. Cathepsin K is a cysteine protease from the papain family of proteases and plays an important role in osteoclast function. In mice, dominant-negative, but not recessive, mutations of Mitf produce osteopetrosis (see 166600), suggesting a functional requirement for other family members, such as TFE3 (314310), TFEB (600744), and TFEC (604732), which are potential dimerization partners. Motyckova et al. (2001) identified cathepsin K as a transcriptional target of MITF and TFE3 (314310) via 3 consensus elements in the cathepsin K promoter. Additionally, cathepsin K mRNA and protein were found to be deficient in Mitf mutant osteoclasts, and overexpression of wildtype Mitf dramatically upregulated the expression of endogenous cathepsin K in cultured human osteoclasts. Cathepsin K promoter activity was disrupted by dominant-negative, but not recessive, mouse alleles of Mitf in a pattern that closely matches their osteopetrotic phenotypes. This relationship between cathepsin K and the MITF family helps explain the phenotypic overlap of their corresponding deficiencies in pycnodysostosis and osteopetrosis and identifies likely regulators of cathepsin K expression in bone homeostasis and human malignancy. To identify MITF-dependent KIT (164920) transcriptional targets in primary human melanocytes, microarray studies were undertaken by McGill et al. (2002). Among identified targets was BCL2 (151430), whose germline deletion produced melanocyte loss and exhibited phenotypic synergy with Mitf in mice. The regulation of BCL2 by MITF was verified in melanocytes and melanoma cells and by chromatin immunoprecipitation of the BCL2 promoter. MITF was found to regulate BCL2 in osteoclasts, and both Mitf mi/mi and Bcl2 -/- mice exhibited severe osteopetrosis. Disruption of MITF in melanocytes or melanoma triggered profound apoptosis susceptible to rescue by BCL2 overexpression. Clinically, primary human melanoma expression microarrays revealed tight nearest neighbor linkage for MITF and BCL2. This linkage helped explain the vital roles of both MITF and BCL2 in the melanocyte lineage and the well-known treatment resistance of melanoma. The Mitf-Tfe family of hHLH-leucine zipper (ZIP) translocation factors comprises 4 members: MITF, TFE3, TFEB (600744), and TFEC (604732). In vitro, each protein in the family can bind DNA as a homo- or heterodimer with other family members. Mutational studies in mice have shown that Mitf is essential for melanocyte and eye development consistent with the causation of a form of Waardenburg syndrome, whereas Tfeb is required for placenta vascularization. Steingrimsson et al. (2002) uncovered a role for Tfe3 in osteoclast development that is functionally redundant with that of Mitf. Although osteoclasts seem normal in Mitf or Tfe3 null mice, the combined loss of the 2 genes resulted in severe osteopetrosis. Steingrimsson et al. (2002) also showed that Tfec mutant mice were phenotypically normal, and that the Tfec mutation does not alter the phenotype of Mitf, Tfeb, or Tfe3 mutant mice. Their studies failed to identify any phenotypic overlap between the different Mitf-Tfe mutations. These results suggested that heterodimeric interactions are not essential for Mitf-Tfe function, in contrast to other bHLH-ZIP families like Myc/Max/Mad, where heterodimeric interactions seem to be essential. Selzer et al. (2002) found that MITF-M was repressed in 8 of 14 established melanoma cell lines tested. Transfection of MITF-M into a melanoma cell line lacking the MITF-M isoform and into a permanent cell line established from normal melanocytes resulted in slower tumor growth. In addition to growth-inhibitory effects, MITF-M expression led to a change in the histopathologic appearance of tumors from epitheloid toward a spindle-cell type in vivo. These results indicated a role for the MITF-M isoform in the in vivo growth control and phenotype of melanoma. Thus, MITF-M may qualify as a marker capable of identifying subgroups of melanoma patients with different tumor biology and prognosis. Widlund et al. (2002) identified beta-catenin (CTNNB1; 116806) as a significant regulator of melanoma cell growth, with MITF as a critical downstream target. Disruption of the canonical Wnt (see 164820) pathway abrogated growth of melanoma cells, and constitutive overexpression of MITF rescued the growth suppression. Yasumoto et al. (2002) found that functional cooperation between MITF-M and LEF1 (153245) in several mammalian cell lines resulted in synergistic transactivation of the DCT promoter, an early melanoblast marker. Beta-catenin was required for efficient transactivation, but was dispensable for the interaction between MITF-M and LEF1. Vetrini et al. (2004) identified an E-box MITF-M-binding element within the OA1 (300500) promoter. Using several in vitro and in vivo approaches, they confirmed that MTF-M bound the OA1 E-box and could drive expression of OA1 in human and mouse melanocytes and retinal pigment epithelium. In addition to its role in melanocyte and melanoma survival and cell cycle progression, Carreira et al. (2005) showed that MITF can act as a novel antiproliferative transcription factor able to induce a G1 cell cycle arrest that is dependent on MITF-mediated activation of the p21(Cip1) (CDKN1A; 116899) cyclin-dependent kinase inhibitor gene. Moreover, cooperation between MITF and the retinoblastoma protein RB1 (180200) potentiates the ability of MITF to activate transcription. Carreira et al. (2005) suggested that MITF-mediated activation of p21(Cip1) expression and consequent hypophosphorylation of RB1 contributes to cell cycle exit and activation of the differentiation program. By integrating SNP array-based genetic maps with gene expression signatures derived from NCI60 cell lines, Garraway et al. (2005) identified the melanocyte master regulator MITF as the target of a novel melanoma amplification. Garraway et al. (2005) found that MITF amplification was more prevalent in metastatic disease and correlated with decreased overall patient survival. BRAF (164757) mutation and p16 (CDKN2A; 600160) inactivation accompanied MITF amplification in melanoma cell lines. Ectopic MITF expression in conjunction with the BRAF mutant (V600E; 164757.0001) transformed primary human melanocytes, and thus MITF can function as a melanoma oncogene. Reduction of MITF activity sensitizes melanoma cells to chemotherapeutic agents. Garraway et al. (2005) suggested that targeting MITF in combination with BRAF or cyclin-dependent kinase inhibitors may offer a rational therapeutic avenue into melanoma, a highly chemotherapy-resistant neoplasm. Garraway et al. (2005) concluded that MITF represents a distinct class of 'lineage survival' or 'lineage addiction' oncogenes required for both tissue-specific cancer development and tumor progression. Larribere et al. (2005) found a role for MITF in apoptosis. They demonstrated that MITF is a caspase-3 (CASP3; 600636) substrate and cleavage of MITF within its C-terminal domain releases a proapoptotic C-terminal fragment. Expression of a noncleavable form of MITF rendered melanoma cells resistant to apoptotic stimuli. Using small interfering RNA directed against MITF, Larribere et al. (2005) found that downregulation of MITF alone did not induce apoptosis, but expression of the C-terminal fragment sensitized melanoma cells to apoptotic stimuli. Loercher et al. (2005) showed that expression of MITF in mouse embryonic fibroblasts resulted in marked growth inhibition and morphologic changes consistent with melanocyte differentiation. MITF regulated cell cycle exit by activating the cell cycle inhibitor INK4A (CDKN2A). MITF bound the INK4A promoter, activated p16(INK4A) mRNA and protein expression, and induced RB1 protein hypophosphorylation, thereby triggering cell cycle arrest. Activation of INK4A was required for efficient melanocyte differentiation, and MITF was required to maintain INK4A expression in mature melanocytes. GENE STRUCTURE Tassabehji et al. (1994) demonstrated that the human MITF gene has 9 exons. Udono et al. (2000) determined that the MITF gene contains 12 exons. The first 4 exons are differentially spliced to encode the unique N termini of the MITF isoforms. All MITF variants contain 8 common downstream exons. MAPPING By somatic cell hybrid studies and fluorescence in situ hybridization, Tachibana et al. (1994) mapped the human MITF gene to a region of chromosome 3 that shows a disrupted syntenic conservation with the region on mouse chromosome 6 to which mi maps, namely, 3p14.1-p12.3. As the human MITF gene was found to reside on chromosome 3, Tachibana et al. (1994) suggested that it may be involved in cases of Waardenburg syndrome type II (WS2A; 193510) that do not show linkage to the PAX3 (606597) locus on chromosome 2. The ermine phenotype, or BADS syndrome (227010), was also mentioned as a possible homolog. MOLECULAR GENETICS Tassabehji et al. (1994) demonstrated mutations in the MITF gene in affected individuals in 2 WS2A families. Both mutations affected splice sites in the MITF gene. One might expect that the MITF mutations would result in abnormal proteins which, when combined with the normal protein, would make dysfunctional dimers. Neither of the mutations appeared to function in that way, and Tassabehji et al. (1994) suggested possible explanations. They also pointed out that Waardenburg syndrome type II is relatively ill-defined, since hearing loss is not universal and the distinction in families with dominant white forelock or dominant heterochromia is often not clear. Furthermore, there are families in which unaffected but sometimes consanguineous parents have children with pigmentary disturbances sometimes combined with hearing loss and/or Hirschsprung disease. In the case of these apparently recessive syndromes, MITF was considered a good candidate for the mutant gene. Steingrimsson et al. (1994) characterized the molecular defects associated with 8 murine mi mutations, which vary both in their mode of inheritance and in the cell types they affect. These molecular data provided insight into the phenotypic and developmental consequences of mi mutations and offered a mouse model for WS2. Jackson and Raymond (1994) and Moore (1995) provided commentaries. Tassabehji et al. (1995) concluded that Waardenburg syndrome type II is heterogeneous, with about 20% of cases caused by mutations in MITF. In the mouse, mi mutations can be dominant or recessive. Dominant alleles are believed to work by a dominant-negative effect. A protein with intact helix-loop-helix and zipper sequences but defective DNA binding or transactivation domains sequesters the normal gene products in inactive dimers. Mutations that prevent dimerization are recessive. Tassabehji et al. (1995) noted that most of the mouse mutations are recessive and most of the human mutations in MITF appear to be dominant. They concluded that MITF is another example of a gene like RET (164761) or PAX3 in which humans are more sensitive than mice to gene dosage effects in heterozygotes. Thaung et al. (2002) carried out a genomewide screen for novel N-ethyl-N-nitrosourea-induced mutations that give rise to eye and vision abnormalities in the mouse, and identified 25 inherited phenotypes that affect all parts of the eye. A combination of genetic mapping, complementation, and molecular analysis revealed that 14 of these were mutations in genes previously identified to play a role in eye pathophysiology, namely Pax6 (607108), Mitf, Egfr (131550), and Pde6b (180072). Many of the others were located in genomic regions lacking candidate genes. ANIMAL MODEL The anophthalmic white (Wh) mutation in Syrian hamsters causes pigmentation abnormalities and variable hearing loss in heterozygotes and absence of pigmentation, profound deafness, and severe eye reduction in homozygotes. Hodgkinson et al. (1998) determined that the Wh phenotype is caused by a nonsense mutation in the hamster Mitf gene that truncates the protein between helices 1 and 2 of the DNA-binding and dimerization domain. The mRNA is destabilized, and the protein is unable to dimerize or bind DNA target sites. The mutant protein does not act through a dominant-negative mechanism, and the Wh mutation is inherited as a semidominant trait.

comment: DESCRIPTION Myelin protein-zero is the major structural protein of peripheral myelin. CLONING Hayasaka et al. (1991) isolated a full-length MPZ cDNA from a fetal spinal cord cDNA library. The deduced 248-amino acid protein was highly homologous to the P0 protein from other species. GENE STRUCTURE Hayasaka et al. (1993) stated that the MPZ gene contains 6 exons. You et al. (1991) found that the Mpz gene in the mouse, like that in the rat, contains 6 exons that span about 7 kb of genomic DNA. MAPPING In connection with the construction of a physical map of human 1q21-q23, Oakey et al. (1992) assigned the human gene, which they symbolized MPP, to a position close to FCGR2A (146790) and APOA2 (107670). By spot-blot hybridization of flow-sorted chromosomes and by fluorescence in situ hybridization, Hayasaka et al. (1993) mapped the MPZ gene to 1q22-q23 in the region of the CMT1B locus (118200). Su et al. (1993) mapped the MPZ gene physically 130 kb centromeric to the Fc receptor immunoglobulin gene cluster in band 1q22. By in situ hybridization, Pham-Dinh et al. (1993) assigned the MPZ gene to 1q21.3-q23, probably 1q22, and also demonstrated that the MPZ gene and the FCGR2A gene are located on the same YAC fragment within about 130 kb of each other. You et al. (1991) mapped the mouse Mpz gene to chromosome 1 by Southern analysis of a Chinese hamster/mouse somatic cell hybrid panel. Using polymorphic restriction enzyme sites in the study of recombinant inbred strains, they linked the gene to genes in a region corresponding to band 1H3. GENE FUNCTION Myelin protein-zero is the major structural protein of peripheral myelin, accounting for more than 50% of the protein present in the sheath of peripheral nerves. Expression of the MPZ gene is restricted to Schwann cells; MPZ is not found in the CNS. An integral membrane glycoprotein of 28 kD, MPZ is thought to link adjacent lamellae and thereby stabilize the myelin assembly. The other 3 major components of myelin are myelin basic protein (159430), myelin proteolipid protein (312080), and myelin-associated glycoprotein (159460); see reviews of Lemke (1986) and Sutcliffe (1987). MOLECULAR GENETICS Mutations in the MPZ gene are associated with the autosomal dominant form of Charcot-Marie-Tooth disease type 1 (CMT1B; 118200) which is characterized by progressive slowing of nerve conduction and hypertrophy of Schwann cells. Mutations in MPZ can also produce the more severe polyneuropathies, Dejerine-Sottas syndrome (DSS; 145900) and congenital hypomyelinating neuropathy (CHN; 605253), as well as several types of axonal CMT2 (see, e.g., 607677). In 2 families with CMT1B, Hayasaka et al. (1993) identified mutations in the MPZ gene (159440.0001-159440.0002). Roa et al. (1996) surveyed 70 unrelated patients with demyelinating polyneuropathy for mutations in the MPZ gene. The 1.5-Mb DNA duplication on chromosome 17p12-p11.2 associated with Charcot-Marie-Tooth disease type 1A (118220) was not present. An ile135-to-thr substitution (159440.0007) in MPZ exon 3 was found in a family with clinically severe early-onset CMT1, and an exon 3 mutation encoding a gly137-to-ser (159440.0008) substitution was identified in a second CMT1 family. The mutations predicted amino acid substitutions in the extracellular domain of the MPZ protein. The observations confirmed the role of MPZ in CMT1B, but suggested to Roa et al. (1996) that MPZ coding region mutations account for only a limited percentage of disease-causing mutations in nonduplication CMT1 patients. In 2 sibs with autosomal recessive DSS, Warner et al. (1996) identified homozygosity for a gly74 frameshift mutation in the MPZ gene (159440.0025). Ikegami et al. (1996) likewise observed the DSS phenotype with homozygosity for mutation in the MPZ gene. The findings are parallel to those found with homozygosity for the PMP22 gene (601097) in the cases reported by Killian and Kloepfer (1979), Lupski et al. (1991), and Kaku et al. (1993). The heterozygous parents presented with CMT1, whereas the homozygous children were more severely affected with DSS. These findings indicated the dosage sensitivity of the MPZ and PMP22 myelin genes and also supported the hypothesis that these clinical entities, CMT1 and DSS, represent variants of the same disease. Nelis et al. (1999) tabulated 56 distinct mutations in the MPZ gene that had been identified in association with hereditary peripheral neuropathy. Marrosu et al. (1998) and Boerkoel et al. (2002) reported mutations in the MPZ gene (159440.0017 and 159440.0020) in patients with classic axonal CMT2 (CMT2I; 607677). Senderek et al. (2000) reported 2 MPZ point mutations in 2 families with classic axonal CMT2I with late onset. De Jonghe et al. (1999), Chapon et al. (1999), Misu et al. (2000), and Senderek et al. (2000) found that the thr124-to-met (T124M) mutation (159440.0016) was associated with a distinct CMT2 axonal phenotype with pupillary anomalies and deafness (CMTJ; 607736). Boerkoel et al. (2002) pointed that at least 6 mutations in the MPZ gene had been reported in patients with Charcot-Marie-Tooth disease type 2. GENOTYPE/PHENOTYPE CORRELATIONS Mutations in the MPZ gene cause distinct neurologic diseases, including CHN, DSS, and CMT1B. Inoue et al. (2004) presented evidence suggesting that truncating mutations in the 5-prime end of the gene result in a milder clinical phenotype than those in the 3-prime end of the gene. Northern blot analysis showed that the mutations associated with the milder phenotype are located in an internal exon and result in a decrease in mutant mRNA compared to most mutations associated with severe disease that are located in the last exon, and are not followed by an intron, which results in a larger accumulation of mutant mRNA. The decrease in mutant mRNA occurs via the nonsense-mediated decay (NMD) pathway, which typically degrades only transcripts containing nonsense mutations that are followed by at least 1 intron (Carter et al., 1996; Nagy and Maquat, 1998). Accordingly, the mutations associated with the more severe phenotype may escape NMD and express large amounts of dominant-negative protein. Similar results were obtained for truncating mutations in the SOX10 gene (602229). Inoue et al. (2004) suggested that, in general, the NMD mechanism may function protectively to functionally convert dominant-negative effects to haploinsufficiency. Most MPZ-truncating mutations associated with severe forms of peripheral neuropathy result in premature termination codons within the terminal or penultimate exons that are not subject to nonsense-mediated decay and are stably translated into mutant proteins with potential dominant-negative activity. However, some truncating mutations at the 3-prime end of MPZ escape the nonsense-mediated decay pathway and cause a mild peripheral neuropathy phenotype. Khajavi et al. (2005) examined the functional properties of MPZ-truncating proteins that escaped nonsense-mediated decay, and found that frameshift mutations associated with severe disease cause an intracellular accumulation of mutant proteins, primarily within the endoplasmic reticulum (ER), which induces apoptosis. They found that curcumin, a chemical compound derived from the curry spice turmeric, releases the ER-retained MPZ mutants into the cytoplasm accompanied by a lower number of apoptotic cells. The findings suggested that curcumin treatment is sufficient to relieve the toxic effect of mutant aggregation-induced apoptosis and has the potential of a therapeutic role in treating selected forms of inherited peripheral neuropathies. ANIMAL MODEL Wrabetz et al. (2000) showed that normal peripheral nerve myelination depends on strict dosage of MPZ, the most abundantly expressed myelin gene. Transgenic mice containing extra copies of Mpz manifested a dose-dependent, dysmyelinating neuropathy, ranging from transient perinatal hypomyelination to arrested myelination and impaired sorting of axons by Schwann cells. Myelination was restored by breeding the transgene into the Mpz-null background, demonstrating that dysmyelination does not result from a structural alteration or Schwann cell-extrinsic effect of the transgenic P0-glycoprotein. The findings suggested that Schwann cells may be susceptible to gene dosage during nerve development.

comment: DESCRIPTION The RET protooncogene is one of the receptor tyrosine kinases, cell-surface molecules that transduce signals for cell growth and differentiation. The RET gene was defined as an oncogene by a classical transfection assay. RET can undergo oncogenic activation in vivo and in vitro by cytogenetic rearrangement (Grieco et al., 1990). Mutations in the RET gene are associated with multiple endocrine neoplasia, type IIA (MEN2A; 171400), multiple endocrine neoplasia, type IIB (MEN2B; 162300), Hirschsprung disease (HSCR; aganglionic megacolon; 142623), and medullary thyroid carcinoma (MTC; 155240). CLONING Takahashi et al. (1985) cloned RET as a chimeric oncogene during a classic NIH-3T3 transformation assay. Takahashi et al. (1988) cloned a RET protooncogene cDNA from a human monocytic leukemia cell line. The lack of a polyadenylation signal suggested that the mRNA extends further 3-prime. The cDNA encodes a deduced 860-amino acid protein with 2 potential transmembrane domains that separate the protein into 3 domains: an N-terminal cytoplasmic domain, a cysteine-rich extracellular domain, and a C-terminal cytoplasmic tyrosine kinase domain. RET also has 9 N-glycosylation sites. The transforming form of RET has an N-terminal truncation of the protooncogene and the last 51 C-terminal amino acids of the protooncogene, including 2 tyrosine residues, are replaced with 9 unrelated amino acids. Northern blot analysis of a human monocytic leukemia cell line detected RET mRNAs of 3.9, 4.5, 6.0, and 7.0 kb. Northern blot analysis of normal mouse tissues detected a major 4.5-kb transcript and a minor 6.0-kb transcript only in spinal cord. RET splice variants contain the first 19 exons of the RET gene, followed by unique 3-prime ends. The variants produce 3 protein isoforms that have 9 (RET9), 51 (RET51), or 43 (RET43) distinct amino acids at their C termini. The final common amino acid in all 3 human isoforms is tyr1062, which is phosphorylated upon RET activation. Carter et al. (2001) noted that the 3 isoforms have different roles in development of the kidney and of neural crest-derived cells. They compared the 3 isoforms across vertebrate species and found that RET9 and RET51 are highly conserved, while RET43 shows higher divergence, even between mouse and human. GENE FUNCTION Iwashita et al. (1996) introduced 5 HSCR mutations into the extracellular domain of human RET cDNA. These mutations were introduced with or without a MEN2A mutation (cys634 to arg; 164761.0011). The 5 mutations in the RET extracellular domain inhibited the transport of the RET protein to the plasma membrane. Introduction of the extracellular domain RET mutation along with the MEN2A mutation led to significant reduction of the transforming activity of MEN2A-RET, for which cell surface expression is required. Iwashita et al. (1996) demonstrated that with the 5 HSCR extracellular domain RET mutations cell surface expression is low. The authors concluded that sufficient levels of RET expression on the cell surface are required for ganglia migration toward the distal portion of the colon or for full differentiation. Pelet et al. (1998) investigated the effect on RET function of 7 HSCR-related missense mutations by introducing them into either a 114-amino acid wildtype RET isoform (RET51) or a constitutively activated form of RET51 (RET-MEN2A). Pelet et al. (1998) reported that 1 mutation affecting the extracytoplasmic cadherin domain (arg231 to his; R231H) and 2 mutations located in the tyrosine kinase domain (lys907 to glu, K907E; or glu921 to lys, E921K) impaired the biologic activity of RET-MEN2A when tested in cultured fibroblast and pheochromocytoma cells. However, the mechanisms resulting in RET inactivation differed since the receptor bearing the R231H extracellular mutation results in an absent RET protein at the cell surface, while the E921K mutation located within the catalytic domain abolished its enzymatic activity. In contrast, 3 mutations mapping to the intracytoplasmic domain neither modified the transforming capacity of RET-MEN2A nor stimulated the catalytic activity of RET in a ligand-independent system (ser767 to arg, pro1039 to leu, met1064 to thr). Finally, the cys609-to-trp HSCR mutation exerted a dual effect on RET since it led to a decrease of the receptor at the cell surface and converted RET51 into a constitutively activated kinase due to the formation of disulfide-linked homodimers. The data demonstrated that allelic heterogeneity at the RET locus in HSCR is associated with various molecular mechanisms responsible for RET dysfunction. Attie-Bitach et al. (1998) reported on in situ hybridization studies of the pattern of RET expression during early development of human embryos between 23 and 42 days. They showed that the RET gene is expressed in the developing kidney (nephric duct, mesonephric tubules, and ureteric bud), the presumptive enteric neuroblasts of the developing enteric nervous system, cranial ganglia (VII+VIII, IX, and X), and in the presumptive motor neurons of the spinal cord. Yet, despite the high level of RET gene expression in the kidney and in the motor neurons of the developing central nervous system, only rare cases with renal agenesis have been reported in Hirschsprung disease patients, and no clinical evidence of spinal cord involvement has been shown in patients carrying RET germline mutations (i.e., multiple endocrine neoplasia syndromes and Hirschsprung disease). Almost 1% of human infants are born with urogenital abnormalities, many of which involve irregular connections between the distal ureters and the bladder. During development, ureters migrate from their initial integration site in the Wolffian ducts up to the base of the bladder in a process referred to by Batourina et al. (2002) as ureter maturation. Double-null knockout mice for the Rara (180242) and Rarb2 genes develop urinary tract abnormalities including renal hypoplasia, incorrectly positioned distal ureters, hydronephrosis, and megaureter (Mendelsohn et al., 1994). Batourina et al. (2001) showed that renal hypoplasia in double mutant mice is caused by impaired branching morphogenesis and that vitamin A normally regulates branching morphogenesis through the receptor tyrosine kinase RET, which Schuchardt et al. (1994) found to be required for ureteric bud growth and branching. Batourina et al. (2002) showed that ureter maturation depends on formation of the 'trigonal wedge,' an epithelial outgrowth from the base of the Wolffian ducts, and that the distal ureter abnormalities seen in double mutant mice and Ret -/- mice are probably caused by a failure of this process. The studies of Batourina et al. (2001) and Batourina et al. (2002) indicated that formation of the trigonal wedge may be essential for correct insertion of the distal ureters into the bladder, and that these events are mediated by the vitamin A and Ret signaling pathways. Salvatore et al. (2000) noted that oncogenic mutations cause constitutive activation of the kinase function of RET, which in turn results in the autophosphorylation of RET tyrosine residues critical for signaling. In vitro kinase assays had previously revealed 6 putative RET autophosphorylation sites. Salvatore et al. (2000) assessed the phosphorylation of 2 residues, tyrosines 1015 and 1062 (Y1015 and Y1062), in the in vivo signaling of RET and RET-derived oncogenes. Using phosphorylated RET-specific antibodies, they demonstrated that both Y1015 and Y1062 are rapidly phosphorylated upon ligand triggering of RET. Regardless of the nature of the underlying activating mutation, the concomitant phosphorylation of Y1015 and Y1062 was a common feature of the various oncogenic RET products (MEN2A, MEN2B, and PTC). Carrasquillo et al. (2002) noted that although 8 genes with mutations that can be associated with Hirschsprung disease had been identified, mutations at individual loci are neither necessary nor sufficient to cause clinical disease. They conducted a genomewide association study in 43 Mennonite family trios (parents and affected child) using 2,083 microsatellites and SNPs and a new multipoint linkage disequilibrium method that searched for association arising from common ancestry. They identified susceptibility loci at 10q11, 13q22, and 16q23; they showed that the gene at 13q22 is EDNRB (131244) and the gene at 10q11 is RET. Statistically significant joint transmission of RET and EDNRB alleles in affected individuals and noncomplementation of aganglionosis in mouse intercrosses between Ret null and the Ednrb hypomorphic piebald allele were suggestive of epistasis between EDNRB and RET. Thus, genetic interaction between mutations in RET and EDNRB is an underlying mechanism for this complex disorder. Japon et al. (2002) found GDNF (600837), GFRA1 (601496), and RET mRNA and protein expression in the human anterior pituitary gland. Double immunohistochemistry of anterior pituitary sections showed GDNF immunoreactivity in more than 95% of somatotrophs and to a lesser extent in corticotrophs (20%); it was almost absent in the remaining cell types. Also, although more than 95% of somatotrophs were stained for RET, no positive immunostaining could be detected in other cell types. Furthermore, they looked for GDNF and RET in human pituitary adenomas of various hormonal phenotypes. They found strong positive immunostaining for RET in all of the GH (139250)-secreting adenomas screened as well as in 50% of ACTH-producing adenomas. They found positive immunostaining for GDNF in all of the GH-secreting adenomas and in 10% of the corticotropinomas. Lastly, they found strong positive immunostaining for GFRA1 in 90% of the somatotropinomas and 50% of the corticotropinomas as well as in 1 of 8 prolactinomas and 1 of 13 nonfunctioning adenomas. The authors concluded that expression of RET in all of the somatotropinomas and in 50% of the ACTH-producing tumors implies that GDNF and RET could be involved in the pathogenesis of pituitary tumors. Using gene expression profiling, Iwashita et al. (2003) determined that genes associated with Hirschsprung disease were highly upregulated in rat gut neural crest stem cells relative to whole-fetus RNA. The genes with highest expression were GDNF, SOX10 (602229), GFRA1, and EDNRB. The highest expression was seen in RET, which was found to be necessary for neural crest stem cell migration in the gut. GDNF promoted the migration of neural crest stem cells in culture but did not affect their survival or proliferation. The observations made by Iwashita et al. (2003) were confirmed by quantitative RT-PCR, flow cytometry, and functional analysis. Bordeaux et al. (2000) found that expression of RET in human embryonic fibroblast and rat olfactory neuroblast cell lines induced apoptosis. The proapoptotic effect of RET was inhibited by its ligand, GDNF. RET induced apoptosis via its own cleavage by caspases, a phenomenon allowing the liberation or exposure of a proapoptotic domain of RET. Five Hirschsprung-associated RET mutations transformed RET into a constitutive inducer of apoptosis, independent of whether or not GDNF was present. Melillo et al. (2001) presented evidence that FRS2 (607743) couples both ligand-regulated and oncogenic forms of RET9 with the MAP kinase signaling cascade under normal biologic conditions and pathologic conditions, such as multiple endocrine neoplasias and papillary thyroid carcinomas (PTC; 188550). Kjaer and Ibanez (2003) investigated the processing and function of a series of missense mutations in the RET extracellular domain (RET(ECD)) causing Hirschsprung disease. All mutations examined prevented the maturation of RET(ECD) in the endoplasmic reticulum and abolished its ability to interact with the GDNF/GFRA1 ligand complex (see 601496), indicating defects in protein folding. Immature forms of RET(ECD) accumulating intracellularly associated with the endoplasmic reticulum chaperone GRP78/BIP (HSPA5; 138120) and showed different degrees of protein ubiquitination. Maturation of RET(ECD) mutants could be rescued by allowing protein expression to proceed at 30 degrees C, a condition known to facilitate protein folding. Analysis of autonomous folding subunits in the RET(ECD) indicated an intrinsic propensity to misfolding in 3 N-terminal cadherin-like domains, CLD1-3. Expression and maturation of these subdomains was specifically improved at 30 degrees C, identifying them as temperature-sensitive determinants in RET(ECD). GENE STRUCTURE Pasini et al. (1995) cloned the entire RET genomic sequence in a contig of cosmids and established the position of the 20 exons of the RET gene with respect to a detailed restriction map based on 8 endonucleases. A highly polymorphic CA repeat sequence was identified within intron 5. The estimated size of the gene is 55 kb. Intron 1 accounts for approximately 24 kb, while exons 2 to 20 are contained within a region of 31 kb. This overall gene structure of a large first intron with small exons interspersed at the 5-prime half and more clustered at the 3-prime half is reminiscent of that of PDGFRB (173410) and KIT (164920), genes that also encode tyrosine kinase receptors. No evidence of RET-related genes or RET pseudogenes in 10q11.2 or elsewhere in the genome was found. They could demonstrate that the orientation of the RET gene on 10q11.2 is 5-prime centromeric/3-prime telomeric. MAPPING By fluorescence in situ hybridization, Ishizaka et al. (1989) assigned the RET oncogene to 10q11.2. Because of the location, they suggested that this might be a candidate gene for multiple endocrine neoplasia type IIA. Lairmore et al. (1993) developed a 1.5-Mb YAC contig containing 3 loci closely linked to the MEN2A locus. The orientation of the contig and order of the 3 markers were cen--RET--D10S94--D10S102--tel. A critical crossover event placed the MEN2A locus centromeric to D10S102. Lairmore et al. (1993) pointed out that no recombination events had been reported between MEN2A and either D10S94 or RET. Mulligan et al. (1993) and Donis-Keller et al. (1993) demonstrated mutations in the RET oncogene that are associated with MEN2A and medullary thyroid carcinoma. MOLECULAR GENETICS - Hirschsprung Disease Attie et al. (1995) studied the 20 exons of the RET gene by a combination of denaturing gradient gel electrophoresis and SSCP in 45 sporadic cases and 35 familial cases of Hirschsprung disease. They found mutations of the RET gene in 50% of familial HSCR, regardless of the length of the aganglionic segment. The mean penetrance of the mutant allele in familial HSCR was significantly higher in males (72%) than in females (51%). Mutations at the RET locus were scattered along the length of the gene and accounted for at least one-third of sporadic HSCR cases in this series. Among the mutations identified in sporadic cases (16/45), 7 proved to be de novo mutations. Taken together, the low penetrance of the mutant gene, the lack of genotype/phenotype correlation, the sex-dependent effect of RET mutations, and the variable clinical expression of the disease support the existence of one or more modifier genes in familial HSCR. Angrist et al. (1995) analyzed the RET gene in 80 HSCR probands by PCR and identified 8 putative mutations. Using the approach of SSCP analysis established for all 20 exons of the RET gene, Seri et al. (1997) identified 7 additional mutations among 39 sporadic and familial cases of Hirschsprung disease (detection rate 18%). They considered that the relatively low efficiency of detecting mutations of RET in Hirschsprung patients cannot be accounted for by genetic heterogeneity, which is not supported by the results of linkage analysis in pedigrees analyzed to date. Almost 74% of the point mutations in their series, as well as in other patient series, were identified among long-segment patients, who represented only 25% of the patient population. Seri et al. (1997) found a C620R substitution in a patient affected with total colonic aganglionosis; the same mutation had been found in medullary thyroid carcinoma. An R313Q mutation (164761.0026) was identified in homozygous state in a child born of consanguineous parents and was associated with the most severe Hirschsprung phenotype, namely, a total colonic aganglionosis with small bowel involvement. Julies et al. (2001) studied 40 HSCR patients from a diverse South African population. The exons of the RET gene were analyzed by heteroduplex-SSCP analysis, and 6 potential disease-related mutations in 8 patients (20%) were identified. Five of the mutations were novel. No mutations were detected in the black patient group, which was either a consequence of the small number of patients studied (9) and limitations imposed by the screening method or a different genetic basis. Bolk Gabriel et al. (2002) reviewed the evidence that RET is the major gene involved in HSCR: only 1 affected family unlinked to RET had been reported; coding sequence mutations occur in 50% of familial and 15 to 35% of sporadic cases; even when the major mutation is in EDNRB, RET variants make some contribution to susceptibility; and homozygous Ret-null mice have full sex-independent penetrance of aganglionosis. Yet, RET mutations are clearly not sufficient to lead to aganglionosis, as the penetrance of mutant alleles is 65% in males and 45% in females. RET is the major gene underlying HSCR primarily in families enriched for long-segment HSCR. To identify the genes critical for the complex inheritance of the much more common short-segment S-HSCR, Bolk Gabriel et al. (2002) conducted a genome screen in families with S-HSCR and identified susceptibility loci at 3p21 (HSCRS2; 606874), 10q11, and 19q12 (HSCRS3; 606875) that seem to be necessary and sufficient to explain recurrence risk and population incidence. The gene at 10q11 appeared to be RET, supporting its crucial role in all forms of HSCR; however, coding sequence mutations were present in only 40% of linked families, suggesting the importance of noncoding variation in RET. Thus they demonstrated oligogenic inheritance of S-HSCR. The 3p21 and 19q12 loci are RET-dependent modifiers of susceptibility. They also demonstrated a parent-of-origin effect at the RET locus. Previously described multiplex families had shown a greater than expected inheritance of HSCR through the maternal lineage. In the 49 families studied by Bolk Gabriel et al. (2002), 27 shared 1 allele identical by descent (IBD) at RET; although the shared allele was expected to be transmitted equally by either parent, they observed, instead, 21 maternal and 6 paternal transmissions. This effect was not gender-specific but a true parent-of-origin effect, as, within the 27 nuclear families with 1 allele IBD, there were 29 affected males and 25 affected females. Analysis of segregation at 3p21 and 19q12 showed no parent-of-origin effects. Fitze et al. (2003) used a dual-luciferase assay to evaluate the activity of different RET promoter haplotypes identified among 80 HSCR patients. Variants of 2 RET promoter polymorphisms, -5G-A and -1C-A, from the transcription start site were associated with HSCR. The -5G-A polymorphism was in strong linkage disequilibrium with a 135G-A polymorphism (164761.0038). The promoter haplotype -5A/-1C associated with HSCR and had a significantly lower expression compared with those haplotypes identified in the majority of normal controls. Fitze et al. (2003) suggested a role for RET haplotypes containing the -5A promoter variant in the etiology of HSCR. Burzynski et al. (2004) typed 13 markers within and flanking the RET gene in 117 Dutch patients with sporadic HSCR, 64 of whom had been screened for RET mutations and found negative, and their parents. There was a strong association between 6 markers in the 5-prime region of RET and HSCR, with significant transmission distortion of those markers. Homozygotes for this 6-marker haplotype had a highly increased risk of developing HSCR (OR greater than 20). Burzynski et al. (2004) concluded that RET may play a crucial role in HSCR even when no RET mutations are found, and that disease-associated variants are likely to be located between the promoter region and exon 2 of the RET gene. Mutations in RET have been found in up to 50% of familial cases of HSCR. For the more common sporadic form of HSCR, RET coding mutations have been found in not more than 20% of patients. Several studies have shown, however, that the RET locus is linked to the disease in almost all familial cases, regardless of their mutation status and is also associated with HSCR in a large proportion of the patients with sporadic HSCR who do not have RET coding mutations. Similar haplotypes were found in the 5-prime region of the RET locus in patients from several European populations with HSCR (Borrego et al., 2003). Burzynski et al. (2004) found a haplotype of 6 SNPs that was transmitted to 55.6% of HSCR patients, whereas it was present in only 16.2% of the controls. Among the patients with that haplotype, 90.8% had it on both chromosomes, which led to a much higher risk of developing HSCR than when the haplotype occurred heterozygously. To more precisely define the HSCR-associated region and to identify candidate disease-associated variant(s), Burzynski et al. (2005) sequenced the shared common haplotype region from 10 kb upstream of the RET gene through intron 1 and exon 2 (in total, 33 kb) in a patient homozygous for the common risk haplotype and in a control individual homozygous for the most common nonrisk haplotype. A comparison of these sequences demonstrated 86 sequence differences. Of these 86 variations, 8 proved to be in regions highly conserved among different vertebrates and within putative transcription factor binding sites. Subsequent genotyping of these 8 variants revealed a strong disease association for 6 of the 8 markers. These 6 markers also showed the largest distortion in allele transmission. Interspecies comparison showed that only 1 of the 6 variations was located in a region also conserved in a nonmammalian species, making it the most likely candidate HSCR-associated variant. Emison et al. (2005) used family-based association studies to identify a disease interval, and integrated this with comparative and functional genomic analysis to prioritize conserved and functional elements within which mutations in RET can be sought. Emison et al. (2005) showed that a common noncoding RET variant within a conserved enhancer-like sequence in intron 1 (164761.0050) is significantly associated with HSCR susceptibility and makes a 20-fold greater contribution to risk than rare alleles do. This mutation reduces in vitro enhancer activity markedly, has low penetrance, and has different genetic effects in males and females, and explains several features of the complex inheritance pattern of HSCR. Thus, Emison et al. (2005) concluded that common low-penetrance variants identified by association studies can underlie both common and rare diseases. Emison et al. (2005) concluded that RET mutations, coding and/or noncoding, are probably a necessary feature in all cases of HSCR. However, RET mutations are not sufficient for HSCR because disease incidence also requires mutations at additional loci. - Central Hypoventilation Syndrome Bolk et al. (1996) stated that 16% of children with congenital central hypoventilation syndrome (CCHS; 209880) have Hirschsprung disease. Because RET mutations have been found in Hirschsprung disease, Bolk et al. (1996) used SSCP analysis to study mutations of the RET gene in 14 patients with CCHS. All detected nucleotide changes in the RET gene were classified as polymorphic variants. On the other hand, Amiel et al. (1998) found a mutation in the RET gene in 1 of 7 children with isolated CCHS. - Multiple Endocrine Neoplasia, Type II Shirahama et al. (1998) investigated the spectrum of RET mutations among Japanese patients by screening the RET gene in 71 patients with thyroid carcinoma. They found mutations in 33 of 34 MEN2A patients and in 5 of 6 FMTC families studied. The met918-to-thr mutation (164761.0013) was found in 4 patients with MEN2B and in 2 of the 22 patients with sporadic medullary thyroid carcinoma. A total of 5 germline mutations were found among the 22 sporadic cases studied, 4 of which were found to be de novo mutations. The authors commented that the high frequency of germline mutations among patients with sporadic medullary thyroid carcinoma has important implications for the clinical management of family members of any patient with this malignancy. Huang et al. (2000) and Koch et al. (2001) identified 2 second-hit mechanisms involved in the development of MEN2-associated tumors: trisomy 10 with duplication of the mutant RET allele and loss of the wildtype RET allele. However, some of the MEN2-associated tumors investigated did not demonstrate either mechanism. Huang et al. (2003) studied the TT cell line, derived from MEN2-associated medullary thyroid carcinoma with a RET germline mutation in codon 634, for alternative mechanisms of tumorigenesis. Although they observed a 2-to-1 ratio between mutant and wildtype RET at the genomic DNA level in this cell line, FISH analysis revealed neither trisomy 10 nor loss of the normal chromosome 10. Instead, a tandem duplication event was responsible for amplification of mutant RET. In further studies Huang et al. (2003) demonstrated for the first time that the genomic chromosome 10 abnormalities in this cell line cause an increased production of mutant RET mRNA. The authors concluded that these findings provided evidence for a third second-hit mechanism resulting in overrepresentation and overexpression of mutant RET in MEN2-associated tumors. - Pheochromocytoma In 5 of 48 apparently sporadic pheochromocytomas (171300), Eng et al. (1995) identified mutations in the RET gene (see, e.g., 164761.0003; 164761.0013). Of these, 1 was proven to be a germline mutation and 2 were proven to be somatic mutations. In 13 (5%) of 271 unrelated patients with sporadic pheochromocytoma, Neumann et al. (2002) identified 7 different germline mutations in the RET gene (see, e.g., 164761.0003-164761.0006; 164761.0011; 164761.0012; 164761.0034). GENOTYPE/PHENOTYPE CORRELATIONS Decker et al. (1998) found that Hirschsprung disease cosegregated with MEN2A in 7 (16%) of 44 families ascertained through MEN2A. The predisposing RET mutations in all 7 families had previously been reported in MEN2A or FMTC and occurred in exon 10 at codons 609, 618, or 620: cys609-to-tyr (164761.0029), cys618-to-ser (164761.0008), cys620-to-arg (164761.0009), and cys620-to-trp (164761.0032). Borrego et al. (1999) studied polymorphic sequence variation in RET in 64 prospectively ascertained individuals with HSCR from the Andalusia region of Spain. For 2 polymorphic variants, A45A (c 135G-A) (164761.0038) and L769L (c 2307T-G), the rare allele was overrepresented in HSCR cases as compared to controls (p less than 0.0006), while the rare allele of the variants G691S (c 2071C-A) and S904S (c 2712C-G) was underrepresented in HSCR cases (p = 0.02). Borrego et al. (1999) concluded that RET polymorphisms predispose to HSCR in a complex low-penetrance manner and may modify phenotypic expression. Fitze et al. (1999) investigated the genotype distribution of polymorphisms of codons 45, 125, 432, 691, 769, 836, and 904 of the coding region of the RET gene in patients with HSCR but without a family history of the disease. The study involved 62 individuals with sporadic HSCR from 2 different areas of Germany, around the cities of Dresden (37 individuals) and Erlangen (25 individuals). The male-to-female ratio was 3.8 to 1. As control subjects, anonymous blood donors were used (117 individuals from Dresden and 39 individuals from Erlangen). The allele frequencies of all polymorphisms in the control population were similar to those reported by others, suggesting that the allele frequency is similar in the German, European, and American populations, but the study did not include data of an ethnically diverse, non-white population. The genotype distribution of each of the 7 polymorphic loci did not deviate significantly from Hardy-Weinberg equilibrium. Fitze et al. (1999) found a highly significant association of the codon 45 polymorphism (164761.0038) in the 2 independent populations with sporadic HSCR. Machens et al. (2001) correlated the RET genotypes (exons 10, 11, 13, and 14) of 63 patients with hereditary medullary thyroid carcinoma (MTC; 155240) with age at diagnosis, sex, the TNM system, and basal calcitonin levels. Mutations in exons 10, 11, 13, and 14 were demonstrated in 22% (14/63), 54% (34/63), 21% (13/63), and 3% (2/63), respectively. The median ages at diagnosis differed significantly (38, 27, 52, and 62 years, respectively). When grouped by cysteine codons (exons 10 and 11 vs exons 13 and 14), this difference became even more evident (30 vs 56 years). Apart from age at diagnosis, no other significant associations were noted. Based on these data, Machens et al. (2001) they devised 3 MTC risk groups according to genotype: a high risk group (codons 634 and 618) with the youngest ages of 3 and 7 years at diagnosis, respectively; an intermediate risk group (codons 790, 620, and 611) with ages of 12, 34, and 42 years; and a low risk group (codons 768 and 804) with ages of 47 and 60 years. Age at diagnosis was unrelated to specific nucleotide and amino acid exchange within each codon. The authors concluded that there is a significant genotype-phenotype correlation, allowing for a more individualized approach to the timing and extent of prophylactic surgery. Niccoli-Sire et al. (2001) analyzed 148 patients from 47 familial MTC-only families, and found noncysteine RET mutations in 59.5% of these families. Of the index cases with noncysteine mutations, 43.4% presented with a multinodular goiter and high basal calcitonin; they were older at diagnosis than those with mutation in exon 10 and had more multifocal MTC, but no difference in size, bilaterality, presence of C cell hyperplasia, or nodal metastases was found. Gene carriers with noncysteine RET mutations had a lower incidence of MTC (78.2% vs 94.1%) than those with mutation in exon 10; 20.2% had C cell hyperplasia only, although thyroidectomized at an older age. The authors concluded that familial MTC with noncysteine RET mutations is not infrequent and is overrepresented in presumed sporadic MTC, suggesting that RET analysis should routinely be extended to exons 13, 14, and 15. The phenotype is characterized by a late onset of the disease, suggesting a delayed appearance of C cell disease rather than a less aggressive form. In familial MTC gene carriers, the optimal timing for thyroidectomy remains controversial. Based on these data, they proposed that surgery should be performed before elevation of the basal calcitonin level, potentially as soon as the pentagastrin test becomes abnormal. Griseri et al. (2000) analyzed a 2508C-T SNP in exon 14 of the RET gene, finding that the T variant was less frequent in patients with HSCR than in the normal population. They demonstrated that the anomalous allelic distribution was due to nonrandom segregation of the T and C alleles in Italian families with HSCR. Griseri et al. (2002) undertook a study to determine whether the observed segregation distortion was due to an increased risk of developing HSCR conferred by the C allele or to a protective effect of the T allele. The typing of several different markers across the RET gene demonstrated that a whole conserved haplotype displayed anomalous distribution and nonrandom segregation in families with HSCR. They provided genetic evidence concerning a protective role of this low-penetrant haplotype in the pathogenesis of HSCR and demonstrated a possible functional effect linked to RET mRNA expression, namely a decrease in the total amount of RET, with enrichment of the RET51 isoform. Germline mutations in RET are associated with both multiple endocrine neoplasia type II, which has MTC as a feature, and HSCR. In the former, gain-of-function mutations are found in a limited set of codons, whereas loss-of-function mutations are found in the latter. Germline RET mutation was associated with only 3% of a population-based series of isolated HSCR (Svensson et al., 1998). Borrego et al. (1999, 2000) found that specific haplotypes comprising RET coding SNPs, including the A45A SNP in exon 2, were strongly associated with HSCR, whereas haplotypes associated with a SNP at codon 836 in exon 14 were associated with MTC. Borrego et al. (2003) described 3 novel SNPs in intron 1, and, together with the coding SNP haplotypes, the data suggested the presence of distinct ancestral haplotypes for HSCR and sporadic MTC in linkage disequilibrium with a putative founding susceptibility locus or loci. The data were consistent with the presence of a very ancient, low-penetrance founder locus approximately 20 to 30 kb upstream of SNP A45A. Punales et al. (2003) observed a wide spectrum of clinical presentation and natural course of medullary thyroid carcinoma even among genetically related individuals with MEN2A. Sixty-nine individuals from 12 different families presented a codon 634 mutation, the most prevailing missense mutation in their series. They identified C634Y (164761.0004) in 49 patients, C634R (164761.0011) in 13, and C634W (164761.0012) in 7. Individuals with the C634R mutation presented significantly more distant metastases at diagnosis than subjects with the C634Y or C634W mutations (54.5% vs 19.4% vs 14.3%, respectively, P = 0.03). Further analysis of the estimated cumulative frequency of lymph node and/or distant metastases by Kaplan-Meier curves showed that the appearance of lymph nodes and metastases occurred later in patients with C634Y than in those with C634R (P = 0.001). The authors concluded that specific nucleotide and amino acid exchanges at codon 634 might have a direct impact on tumor aggressiveness in MEN2A syndrome. Kashuk et al. (2005) reported the alignment of the human RET protein sequence with the orthologous sequences of 12 nonhuman vertebrates, their comparative analysis, the evolutionary topology of the RET protein, and predicted tolerance for all published missense mutations. CYTOGENETICS Familial adenomatous polyposis (FAP; 175100) is caused by germline mutations of the adenomatous polyposis coli (APC) gene, and it is associated with an increased risk of developing papillary thyroid carcinomas. A significant fraction of sporadic human papillary thyroid carcinomas have RET protooncogene rearrangements. These rearrangements generate chimeric transforming oncogenes designated RET/PTC. See 188550. Cetta et al. (1998) used an immunohistochemical and RT-PCR approach to analyze for RET/PTC activation in papillary thyroid carcinomas in 2 FAP kindreds, both showing typical APC gene mutations. Kindred 1 had 7 members affected by FAP, and among these, 3 patients had papillary thyroid carcinomas. Kindred 2 had 2 patients, mother and daughter, who were affected by colonic polyposis; the daughter also had a papillary carcinoma. Cetta et al. (1998) found RET/PTC1 oncogene activation in 2 of 3 papillary carcinomas of FAP kindred 1 and in the papillary carcinoma of FAP kindred 2. These findings showed that loss of function of APC coexists with gain of function of RET in some papillary thyroid carcinomas, suggesting that RET/PTC1 oncogene activation could be a progression step in the development of FAP-associated thyroid tumors. By RT-PCR screening of PTCs of 2 patients exposed to radioactive fallout after the Chernobyl nuclear power plant disaster, followed by 5-prime RACE, Klugbauer et al. (1998) identified a novel RET rearrangement, PTC5, involving fusion of the RET tyrosine kinase domain to RFG5 (GOLGA5; 606918). Klugbauer and Rabes (1999) identified 2 novel types of RET rearrangements in papillary thyroid carcinoma, which they termed PTC6 and PTC7. In PTC6, RET is fused to the N-terminal part of transcriptional intermediary factor-1-alpha (TIF1A; 603406), and in PTC7, RET is fused to a C-terminal part of TIF1-gamma (TIF1G; 605769). In a papillary thyroid carcinoma, Nakata et al. (1999) found fusion of the ELKS (607127) and RET genes due to the translocation t(10;12)(q11;p13). By PCR analysis of normal thyroid tissue and the papillary thyroid carcinoma, Nakata et al. (1999) found that the ELKS-RET fusion transcript was expressed only in the tumor. By sequence analysis, they determined that amino acid 691 of ELKS was fused to amino acid 713 of RET. Functionally, this fusion would juxtapose the kinase domain of RET to the coiled-coil structure of ELKS. Nakata et al. (1999) noted that since the RET gene is not expressed in the thyroid follicular cells from which papillary thyroid carcinoma develops, and because dimerization causes RET activation, the fusion of RET with ELKS would cause the kinase domain of RET to be expressed inappropriately in thyroid cancer tissue. They also confirmed dimerization of the fusion protein in vivo. Klugbauer et al. (2001) identified 22 reciprocal and 4 nonreciprocal ELE1 (601984) and RET rearrangements, referred to as PTC3 rearrangements, in 26 post-Chernobyl PTC tumor samples. Breakpoints were distributed in the affected introns of both genes without significant clustering, and there was no accumulation of breakpoints at the 2 Alu elements in the ELE1 sequence. However, at least 1 topoisomerase I (126420) site was found at or near all breakpoints, indicating a potential role for this enzyme in the formation of DNA strand breaks and/or ELE1 and RET inversions. Due to the presence of short regions of sequence homology and short direct and inverted repeats at the majority of breakpoints, Klugbauer et al. (2001) concluded that chimeric ELE1/RET and RET/ELE1 genes are formed by a nonhomologous DNA end-joining mechanism. ANIMAL MODEL Smith-Hicks et al. (2000) developed a mouse model of MEN2B by introducing a point mutation in the mouse Ret gene corresponding to the disease-associated met918-to-thr (M918T; 164761.0013) substitution in the human RET gene. Mutant mice displayed C-cell hyperplasia and chromaffin cell hyperplasia that progressed to pheochromocytoma. Homozygous mice did not develop gastrointestinal ganglioneuromas, but displayed ganglioneuromas of the adrenal medulla, enlargement of the associated sympathetic ganglia, and a male reproductive defect. There were no defects attributable to a loss-of-function mutation, and development of the kidneys and enteric nervous system was normal. Tyr1062 of RET is a binding site for the phosphotyrosine-binding domains of several adaptor and effector proteins important for the activation of intracellular signaling pathways, such as the RAS (see 190020)/ERK (see 601795), PI3 kinase (see 601232)/AKT (see 164730), and JNK (see 601158) pathways. Jijiwa et al. (2004) examined the role of tyr1062 in organogenesis in transgenic mice carrying a knockin gene with a tyr1062-to-phe mutation. Homozygous knockin mice were born normally, but they showed growth retardation and died by day 27. Development of the enteric nervous system was severely impaired in homozygous mutant mice, and about 40% lacked enteric neurons in the whole intestinal tract, as observed in Ret-deficient mice. Other mutant mice developed enteric neurons in the intestine at various extents, although the size and number of ganglion cells were significantly reduced. Unlike Ret-deficient mice, a small kidney developed in all knockin mice, accompanied by a slight histologic change. The reduced kidney size was due to a decrease of ureteric bud branching during embryogenesis. Jijiwa et al. (2004) concluded that RET signaling via tyr1062 plays an important role in the development of the enteric nervous system and kidney. HISTORY - REVIEWS Eng (1996) reviewed the role of the RET protooncogene in multiple endocrine neoplasia type II and in Hirschsprung disease. Hoppener and Lips (1996) also reviewed RET gene mutations from the point of view of the molecular biology and the clinical aspects. Eng and Mulligan (1997) tabulated mutations of the RET gene in MEN2, the related sporadic tumors medullary thyroid carcinoma and pheochromocytoma, and familial and sporadic Hirschsprung disease. Germline mutations in 1 of 8 codons within RET cause the 3 subtypes of MEN2, namely, MEN2A, MEN2B, and familial medullary thyroid carcinoma. They stated that a somatic M918T mutation accounts for the largest proportion of RET mutations detected in medullary thyroid carcinomas, most series showing a 30% to 50% range. It appeared that pheochromocytomas have a wider range of RET mutations. In contrast to MEN2, approximately 25% of patients with Hirschsprung disease have germline mutations scattered throughout the length of RET. Fearon (1997) reviewed more than 20 different hereditary cancer syndromes that had been defined and attributed to specific germline mutations in various inherited cancer genes. In a useful diagram, he illustrated the roles of allelic variation ('1 gene - different syndromes') and genetic heterogeneity ('different genes - 1 syndrome') in inherited cancer syndromes. For example, some missense mutations, e.g., in codon 609 cause MEN2A and a familial medullary thyroid carcinoma; others, e.g., missense mutations in codon 918, cause MEN2B; yet other mutations cause Hirschsprung disease. Cote and Gagel (2003) reviewed the distinct strategies that emerged from the study of familial medullary thyroid cancer that may help in managing genetic cancers. They diagrammed the earliest reported age at the onset of MTC according to specific RET mutation.

comment: CLONING Transgenic mice bearing oncogenes provide valuable new insights into the process of malignant transformation. One of the best studied transgenic mouse models of hematopoietic malignancies is the transgenic mouse overexpressing the c-myc gene in its lymphoid compartment by virtue of the immunoglobulin heavy chain enhancer (E-mu). These mice develop B-cell lymphomas of clonal origin after a variable latency period. Infection of E-mu/myc transgenic mice with Moloney murine leukemia virus (MuLV) is an efficient way to identify oncogenes that synergize with the transgene. In about half of independently induced pre-B-cell lymphomas, the provirus integrates in or near the Bmi1 gene, resulting in enhanced transcription of that gene. The murine Bmi1 protein is found in the nucleus and harbors structural motifs found in nuclear proteins, including a novel putative zinc finger shared by a diverse set of proteins involved in gene regulation, DNA recombination, and DNA repair. The product of the Bmi1 gene showed 70% identity with the Mel18 protein gene (165040), which was isolated from a mouse melanoma cell line. The Bmi1 gene is highly conserved in evolution as indicated by zoo blot hybridization with Bmi1 probes corresponding to the protein-encoding domain. Alkema et al. (1993) isolated the human BMI1 cDNA. The 3,203-bp cDNA shows 86% identity to the mouse nucleotide sequence. The open reading frame encodes a protein of 326 amino acids which shares 98% identity to the 324-amino acid sequence of the mouse protein. GENE STRUCTURE Alkema et al. (1993) determined that the human BMI1 gene consists of at least 10 exons. The murine bmi1 gene consists of 10 exons. GENE FUNCTION While screening for proteins that interact with the BMI1 protein, Satijn et al. (1997) isolated the RING1 protein (602045). They showed that BMI1 and RING1 bind in vitro and colocalize in the nuclei of 2 types of sarcoma cells. Satijn et al. (1997) stated that BMI1 and RING1 may be part of a protein complex. According to Lessard and Sauvageau (2003) an emerging concept in the field of cancer biology is that a rare population of 'tumor stem cells' exists among the heterogeneous group of cells that constitute a tumor. This concept, best described with human leukemia, indicates that stem cell function (whether normal or neoplastic) might be defined by a common set of critical genes. Lessard and Sauvageau (2003) showed that BMI1 has a key role in regulating the proliferative activity of normal stem and progenitor cells. Most importantly, they provided evidence that the proliferative potential of leukemic stem and progenitor cells lacking BMI1 is compromised because they eventually undergo proliferation arrest and show signs of differentiation and apoptosis, leading to transplant failure of the leukemia. Complementation studies showed that BMI1 completely rescues these proliferative defects. Lessard and Sauvageau (2003) concluded that BMI1 has an essential role in regulating the proliferative activity of both normal and leukemic stem cells. Itahana et al. (2003) stated that BMI1 represses the INK4A locus which encodes the tumor suppressors p16(INK4A) and p14(ARF). They found that BMI1 was downregulated during replicative senescence, but not quiescence, in a human fibroblast cell line. Furthermore, overexpression extended the replicative life span of the fibroblasts, and required RB (180200) but not p53 (191170). Deletion analysis showed that the RING finger and helix-turn-helix domains of BMI1 were required for life span extension and repression of the tumor suppressor p16(INK4). Furthermore, a RING finger deletion mutant that exhibited dominant negative activity induced p16(INK4) and premature senescence. Some presenescent cultures contained growth-arrested cells expressing high levels of p16(INK4) and were apparently arrested by a p53- and telomere-independent mechanism. BMI1 selectively extended the life span of these cultures. Wang et al. (2004) showed that an E3 ubiquitin ligase complex, which they designated Polycomb repressive complex-1-like (PRC1L), specifically monoubiquitinates histone-2A (H2A; see 142711) at lys119. They found that PRC1L is composed of several PcG proteins, including RING1, RNF2 (608985), BMI1, and HPH2 (EDR2; 602979). Reduction of RNF2 expression resulted in a dramatic decrease in the level of ubiquitinated H2A in HeLa cells. Wang et al. (2004) proposed that H2A ubiquitination is linked to Polycomb silencing. MAPPING Alkema et al. (1993) assigned the human BMI1 gene to 10p13 by fluorescence in situ hybridization. The authors stated that the region 10p13 is known to be involved in translocations in various leukemias. ANIMAL MODEL The protein encoded by the BMI1 gene has a domain of homology to a Drosophila protein encoded by a member of the Polycomb-group gene family, which is required to maintain the repression of homeotic genes that regulate the identities of Drosophila segments. The fact that mice lacking the BMI1 gene showed posterior transformations of the axial skeleton suggested that the gene may play a similar role in vertebrates. Alkema et al. (1995) found that transgenic mice overexpressing the Bmi1 protein showed the opposite phenotype, namely a dose-dependent anterior transformation of vertebral identity. The anterior expression boundary of the Hoxc5 gene was shifted in the posterior direction, indicating that Bmi1 is involved in the repression of Hox genes. Thus, BMI1 appears to be a member of a vertebrate Polycomb complex that regulates segmental identity by repressing HOX genes throughout development. Molofsky et al. (2003) showed that in the mouse, Bmi1 is required for the self-renewal of stem cells in the peripheral and central nervous systems but not for their survival or differentiation. The reduced self-renewal of Bmi1-deficient neural stem cells led to their postnatal depletion. In the absence of Bmi1, the cyclin-dependent kinase inhibitor gene P16(Ink4a) (600160) was upregulated in neural stem cells, reducing the rate of proliferation. P16(Ink4a) deficiency partially reversed the self-renewal defect in Bmi1 null neural stem cells. This conserved requirement for Bmi1 to promote self-renewal and to repress p16(Ink4a) expression suggested that a common mechanism regulates the self-renewal and postnatal persistence of diverse types of stem cells. Restricted neural progenitors from the gut and forebrain proliferated normally in the absence of Bmi1. Thus, Molofsky et al. (2003) concluded that BMI1 dependence distinguishes stem cell self-renewal from restricted progenitor proliferation in these tissues. Kranc et al. (2003) found that Cited2 (602937) null mouse fibroblasts showed reduced proliferation that was associated with reduced Bmi1 and Mel18 (600346) expression, and increased Ink4a/Arf expression. Bmi1- and Mel18-expressing retroviruses enhanced the proliferation of Cited2 null fibroblasts, indicating that they function downstream of Cited2. Kranc et al. (2003) concluded that CITED2 controls the expression of INK4A/ARF and fibroblast proliferation, at least in part, via the polycomb-group genes BMI1 and MEL18. Park et al. (2003) found that adult and fetal mouse and adult human hematopoietic stem cells (HSCs) express the protooncogene Bmi1. The number of HSCs in fetal liver of Bmi1 -/- mice was normal. In postnatal Bmi1 -/- mice, the number of HSCs was markedly reduced. Transplanted fetal liver and bone marrow cells obtained from Bmi1 -/- mice were able to contribute only transiently to hematopoiesis. There was no detectable self-renewal of adult HSCs, indicating a cell autonomous defect in Bmi1 null mice. Gene expression analysis revealed that the expression of stem cell-associated genes, cell survival genes, transcription factors, and genes modulating proliferation, including p16(Ink4a) and p19(Arf) (see 600160), was altered in bone marrow cells of the Bmi1 null mice. Expression of p16(Ink4a) and p19(Arf) in normal HSCs resulted in proliferative arrest and p53 (191170)-dependent cell death, respectively. Park et al. (2003) concluded that Bmi1 is essential for the generation of self-renewing adult HSCs. Leung et al. (2004) demonstrated that BMI1 is strongly expressed in proliferating cerebellar precursor cells in mice and humans. Using Bmi1 null mice, Leung et al. (2004) demonstrated a crucial role for Bmi1 in clonal expansion of granule cell precursors both in vivo and in vitro. Deregulated proliferation of these progenitor cells, by activation of the sonic hedgehog (SHH; 600725) pathway, leads to medulloblastoma development (see 155255). Leung et al. (2004) also demonstrated linked overexpression of BMI1 and patched (601309), suggestive of SHH pathway activation, in a substantial fraction of primary human medulloblastomas. Together with the rapid induction of Bmi1 expression on addition of Shh or on overexpression of the Shh target Gli1 (165220) in cerebellar granule cell cultures, Leung et al. (2004) concluded that their findings implicate BMI1 overexpression as an alternative or additive mechanism in the pathogenesis of medulloblastomas, and highlight a role for BMI1-containing polycomb complexes in proliferation of cerebellar precursor cells.

comment: CLONING Sakamoto et al. (1986) tested the capacity for malignant transformation of DNA from 21 stomach cancers, 16 stomach cancers metastatic to lymph nodes, and 21 specimens of apparently noncancerous stomach mucosa from a total of 26 patients with stomach cancer. The DNA was transferred to NIH 3T3 cells by the calcium precipitation technique. Transforming ability was shown by 3 samples: a primary cancer, a metastatic cancer, and a presumably normal gastric mucosa. The transforming gene from the primary cancer was cloned. It bore no homology with previously reported transforming sequences. Taira et al. (1987) isolated an HST cDNA clone that had an efficient transforming activity in a focus-forming assay when it was inserted into an expression vector. Characterization of this clone allowed Taira et al. (1987) to predict that a 206-amino acid protein product was responsible for this transforming activity. In an addendum, Taira et al. (1987) indicated that 42.3% homology existed between the amino acid residues of 1 ORF (open reading frame) of HST and part of bovine basic fibroblast growth factor. They suggested that further studies would elucidate the role of the HST gene in the development of stomach cancer which, they stated, has the highest incidence of all known cancers. Both HST and INT2 (164950) are in the fibroblast growth factor family of oncogenes. Yoshida et al. (1988) reported expression of HST1 in a human teratoma cell line and in 5 of 9 surgically resected human testicular germ cell tumors including seminomas and embryonal carcinomas. HST1, for which the designation HSTF1 was proposed for human gene nomenclature, is a heparin-binding growth factor with significant homology to human fibroblast growth factors and the mouse Int-2 protein. Huebner et al. (1988) isolated the same oncogene by transfection of Kaposi sarcoma DNA and demonstrated its significant homology to both basic and acidic FGFs ( see 134920 and 131220). Because of its origin from Kaposi sarcoma and because of its similarity to FGFs, they designated the oncogene 'K-FGF.' GENE STRUCTURE Huebner et al. (1988) found that sequences adjacent to the 3-prime end of the K-FGF coding sequence in transfectants probably derived from the part of the genome lying between 12p12 and 12q13. Whether the juxtaposition of the chromosome 11-linked K-FGF gene to the chromosome 12-linked sequences within the original transfectants was pure accident remained to be determined. (It had earlier been demonstrated that sequences from the FMS oncogene on chromosome 5 were included in the transfectant.) MAPPING By in situ hybridization, Adelaide et al. (1988) mapped the HST gene to chromosome 11q13. This is also the location of the INT2 gene. Furthermore, Adelaide et al. (1988) found the 2 genes to be coamplified in a human melanoma. Huebner et al. (1988) mapped the K-FGF oncogene to 11q11-q23 by hybridization studies using DNA from rodent-human somatic cell hybrids and then localized it more precisely to 11q13 by in situ hybridization. The 11q13 region is also the site of the BCL1 gene (168461), which is involved in the 11;14 translocation characteristic of some B-cell tumors; see 151400. The oncogene SEA (165110) has also been mapped to 11q13. By pulsed-field gel electrophoresis and by analysis of overlapping cosmid clones, Wada et al. (1988) concluded that HST1 is located about 35 kb downstream of INT2 in the same transcriptional orientation. GENE FUNCTION For a review of the role of this gene in limb development, see Johnson and Tabin (1997). Zuniga et al. (1999) reported that the secreted bone morphogenetic protein (BMP) antagonist Gremlin (603054) relays the sonic hedgehog (SHH; 600725) signal from the polarizing region to the apical ectodermal ridge. Mesenchymal Gremlin expression is lost in limb buds of mouse embryos homozygous for the 'limb deformity' (ld) mutation, which disrupts establishment of the Shh/Fgf4 feedback loop. Grafting Gremlin-expressing cells into ld mutant limb buds rescued Fgf4 expression and restored the Shh/Fgf4 feedback loop. Analysis of Shh-null mutant embryos revealed that Shh signaling is required for maintenance of Gremlin and Formin (136535), the gene disrupted by the ld mutations. In contrast, Formin, Gremlin, and Fgf4 activation were independent of Shh signaling. Zuniga et al. (1999) concluded that the study uncovered the cascade by which the SHH signal is relayed from the posterior mesenchyme to the apical ectodermal ridge and established that Formin-dependent activation of the BMP antagonist Gremlin is sufficient to induce FGF4 and establish the SHH/FGF4 feedback loop. Kratochwil et al. (2002) concluded that FGF4 is a direct target of LEF1 (153245) and Wnt signaling during tooth development in mice. Kratochwil et al. (2002) showed that beads soaked with recombinant FGF4 protein could fully overcome the developmental arrest of tooth germs seen in Lef1-deficient mice. The FGF4 beads also induced delayed expression of Shh (600725) in the epithelium. Using a chemical inhibitor of FGF signaling, Kratochwil et al. (2002) was able to mimic the arrest of tooth development seen in Lef1-deficient mice. The authors hypothesized that the sole function of LEF1 in odontogenesis may be to activate Fgf4 and to connect the Wnt and FGF signaling pathways at a specific developmental step. Vertebrate limb outgrowth is driven by a positive feedback loop involving SHH, Gremlin, and FGF4. By overexpressing individual components of the loop at a time after these genes are normally downregulated in chicken embryos, Scherz et al. (2004) found that Shh no longer maintains Gremlin in the posterior limb. Shh-expressing cells and their descendants cannot express Gremlin. The proliferation of these descendants forms a barrier separating the Shh signal from Gremlin-expressing cells, which breaks down the Shh-Fgf4 loop and thereby affects limb size and provides a mechanism explaining regulative properties of the limb bud. ANIMAL MODEL Feldman et al. (1995) demonstrated that Fgf4 -/- embryos die on embryonic day 5.0. To circumvent this early lethality and assess Fgf4 function in limb development, Sun et al. (2000) used the Cre/loxP system and found that Shh expression is maintained and limb formation is normal when Fgf4 is inactivated in mouse limbs, contradicting another model which suggested that Fgf4 expression is not maintained in Shh -/- mouse limbs. Sun et al. (2000) also found that maintenance of Fgf9 (600921) and Fgf17 (603725) expression is dependent on Shh, whereas Fgf8 (600483) expression is not. Sun et al. (2000) developed a model in which no individual Fgf expressed in the apical ectodermal ridge is solely necessary to maintain Shh expression, but instead the combined activity of 2 or more apical ectodermal ridge Fgfs function in a positive feedback loop with Shh to control limb development. To determine the role of fibroblast growth factor signaling from the apical ectodermal ridge, Sun et al. (2002) inactivated Fgf4 and Fgf8 (600483) in apical ectodermal ridge cells or their precursors at different stages of mouse limb development. Sun et al. (2002) showed that Fgf4 and Fgf8 regulate cell number in the nascent limb bud and are required for survival of cells located far from the apical ectodermal ridge. On the basis of the skeletal phenotypes observed, Sun et al. (2002) concluded that these functions are essential to ensure that sufficient progenitor cells are available to form the normal complement of skeletal elements, and perhaps other limb tissues. In the absence of both Fgf4 and Fgf8 activities, limb development fails. None of 23 newborn double knockout mice examined had hindlimbs. In contrast, forelimbs contained elements of all 3 limb segments but were shorter and thinner than normal. Sun et al. (2002) found that in double homozygotes, forelimb proximal elements were invariably missing or severely hypoplastic when distal elements were present. They suggested that these observations argue against the progress zone model, which had been the prevailing model of limb proximal-distal patterning. Sun et al. (2002) hypothesized that limb skeletal patterning is achieved as a function of basic cellular processes including cell division, cell survival, and stereotypic behaviors of chondrocyte progenitors such as aggregate formation. In a series of experiments involving removal of the apical ectodermal ridge from chick limb buds, Dudley et al. (2002) demonstrated that the various limb bud segments are specified early in limb development as distinct domains, with subsequent development involving expansion of progenitor populations before differentiation. Dudley et al. (2002) also found that the distal limb mesenchyme becomes progressively determined, that is, irreversibly fixed, to a progressively limited range of potential proximodistal fates. Their observations, coupled with those of Sun et al. (2002), refuted the progress zone model of vertebrate limb development.

comment: CLONING Kinzler et al. (1987) identified a gene, termed glioma-associated oncogene (GLI) by them, that is amplified more than 50-fold in a malignant glioma. The gene was expressed at high levels in the original tumor and its derived cell line. Kinzler et al. (1988) extended this work by cloning the GLI complementary DNA. Analysis of the nucleotide sequence demonstrated that the gene contains 5 repeats of the DNA-binding consensus sequence (zinc finger). The zinc fingers contain sequence elements that place the GLI gene product among the Kruppel (Kr) family of zinc finger proteins (see 165230). (The German word 'Kruppel' means 'cripple' or 'dwarf.') The Drosophila gene is a member of the gap class of segmentation genes; thoracic and anterior abdominal segments fail to form in Kr mutant embryos. Kr encodes a chromatin-associated phosphoprotein that contains 5 zinc fingers with a consensus sequence connecting the histidine of 1 finger to the cysteine of the next. Conservation of the contiguous stretch of nucleotides encoding this H-C link allowed cloning of Kruppel-related genes from D. melanogaster, mouse, and frog, by hybridization with Kr cDNA at low stringency. Each of these Kr family members were shown to be expressed in embryonic cells, suggesting a role for them in normal development. Northern analysis revealed that GLI is expressed in embryonal carcinoma cells but not in most adult tissue. A fragile site of the folic acid type has been described at 12q13. In addition, translocations involving this region of chromosome 12 have been described in myxoid liposarcoma (151900) and salivary gland tumors. Southern blot analysis with probes for INT1 (164820) and IGF1 (147440), both of which are located on chromosome 12, showed that these genes are not amplified in the malignant glioma. GENE FUNCTION Using confocal microscopy, immunoprecipitation, and luciferase reporter analysis, Kogerman et al. (1999) demonstrated that a centrally located leucine-rich CRM1 (602559)-dependent nuclear export signal causes the 1,106-amino acid GLI1 protein to be retained in the cytoplasm, where it is colocalized with SUFU (607035). SUFU inhibits the transcriptional activity of GLI1. Ahn and Joyner (2005) adopted an in vivo genetic fate-mapping strategy using Gli1 as a sensitive readout of sonic hedgehog (Shh; 600725) activity to systematically mark and follow the fate of Shh-responding cells in the adult mouse forebrain. They showed that initially, only a small population of cells (including both quiescent neural stem cells and transit-amplifying cells) responds to Shh in regions undergoing neurogenesis. This population subsequently expands markedly to continuously provide new neurons in the forebrain. Ahn and Joyner (2005) concluded that their study of the behavior of quiescent neural stem cells provides in vivo evidence that they can self-renew for over a year and generate multiple cell types. Furthermore, Ahn and Joyner (2005) showed that the neural stem cell niches in the subventricular zone and dentate gyrus are established sequentially and not until late embryonic stages. Basal cell carcinoma (604451) is the most prevalent cancer in the Western world and it is showing a rapid increase in incidence. Activation of the SHH/patched (PTCH; 601309) signaling pathway because of PTCH1 inactivation is a key event in sporadic and familial basal cell carcinoma development and is associated with transcriptional activation of several target genes, including PTCH1 itself. These changes are analogous to the situation in Drosophila where hedgehog activates the zinc finger transcription factor Cubitus interruptus, leading to increased transcription of target genes. Nilsson et al. (2000) showed that mice ectopically expressing the human Cubitus interruptus homolog GLI1 in the skin developed tumors closely resembling human basal cell carcinomas as well as other hair follicle-derived neoplasias, such as trichoepitheliomas (601606), cylindromas (132700), and trichoblastomas. Examination of the tumors revealed wildtype p53 (191170) and HRAS (190020) genes. These findings firmly established that increased GLI1 expression is central and probably sufficient for tumor development and suggested that GLI1-induced tumor development does not depend on additional p53 or HRAS mutations. MAPPING Kinzler et al. (1987) localized the GLI gene to 12q13-q14.3 by Southern blot analysis of hybrid cell DNA and by in situ hybridization. By in situ hybridization, Arheden et al. (1989) localized the GLI1 gene to 12q13.3-q14.1. By in situ hybridization, Dal Cin et al. (1989) narrowed the assignment of GLI1 to the distal part of band 12q13 (12q13.2 or 12q13.3). The corresponding gene is located on mouse chromosome 10 (Justice et al., 1990). MOLECULAR GENETICS Chung and Seizinger (1992) reviewed the molecular genetics of neurologic tumors, including the role of the GLI oncogene. ANIMAL MODEL The secreted glycoprotein Sonic hedgehog (SHH) is thought to act as an endodermal signal that controls hindgut patterning and lung growth. In mice, 3 zinc finger transcription factors, Gli1, Gli2, and Gli3, have been implicated in the transduction of Shh signal. Motoyama et al. (1998) found that mutant mice lacking Gli2 function exhibit foregut defects, including stenosis of the esophagus and trachea, as well as hypoplasia and lobulation defects of the lung. A reduction of 50% in the gene dosage of Gli3 (165240) in a Gli2-/- background resulted in esophageal atresia with tracheoesophageal fistula and a severe disruption of lung development. Mutant mice lacking both Gli2 and Gli3 function did not form esophagus, trachea, or lung. These results indicated that Gli2 and Gli3 possess specific and overlapping functions in Shh signaling during foregut development, and suggested that mutations in GLI genes may be involved in human foregut malformations.

comment: CLONING The GLI gene (165220) was discovered and so-named by reason of its amplification in gliomas of the brain. Sequencing of GLI cDNA clones showed the presence of 5 tandem zinc fingers connected by histidine-cysteine links, which indicated that the gene belongs to the family of zinc finger genes related to Kruppel (Kr). The Drosophila gene Kr is a member of the gap class of segmentation genes; thoracic and anterior abdominal segments fail to form in Kr mutant embryos. This suggested to Ruppert et al. (1988) that other genes of this class might prove important in normal or disease states. Indeed, other genes important in neoplasia, such as NMYC (164840), LMYC (164850), HER2 (164870), and NRAS (164790), have been identified partly by their homology to previously identified oncogenes. Therefore, Ruppert et al. (1988) used a GLI cDNA fragment encoding the zinc finger region to isolate related human sequences. Six distinct loci were identified in this manner. Partial sequencing revealed that each open reading frame was capable of encoding fingers with H-C links. Most of these sequences were found to be expressed in several adult tissues. Using DNA from human-rodent hybrid panels in hybridization studies with probes representing each of 6 distinct loci (identified as distinct by patterns of RNA expression and species conservation), Ruppert et al. (1988) demonstrated that the 6 loci are located on 5 different chromosomes: GLI2 was concordant with NMYC on chromosome 2; GLI3 with epidermal growth factor receptor (131550) on chromosome 7; HKR1 and HKR2 with APOE (107741) on chromosome 19; HKR3 with NRAS on chromosome 1; and HKR4 with MYC (190080) on chromosome 8. MAPPING By fluorescence in situ hybridization, Matsumoto et al. (1996) refined the assignment of the GLI2 gene to 2q14. MOLECULAR GENETICS Diminished Sonic hedgehog (SHH; 600725) signaling is associated with the most common forebrain defect in humans, holoprosencephaly (HPE; 236100), which includes cyclopia, a phenotype also seen in mice and other vertebrates with defective Shh signaling. The secreted protein SHH acts as a crucial factor that patterns the ventral forebrain and is required for the division of the primordial eye field and brain into 2 distinct halves. GLI2 is 1 of 3 vertebrate transcription factors implicated as obligatory mediators of SHH signal transduction. In affected members of 2 families with a distinctive phenotype (within the HPE spectrum) whose primary features included defective anterior pituitary formation and panhypopituitarism, with or without overt forebrain cleavage abnormalities, and HPE-like midfacial hypoplasia, Roessler et al. (2003) identified loss-of-function mutations in the GLI2 gene (165230.0001-165230.0002). They demonstrated that these mutations lacked GLI2 activity, and highlighted the role of GLI2 in human head development. They also pointed out that the occasional pituitary hypoplasia and/or holoprosencephaly seen in patients with Pallister-Hall syndrome (146510) caused by mutation in the GLI3 gene (165240) could be consistent with the possibility that GLI3 also partakes in the mediation of the SHH signal in the ventral forebrain and that this cannot always be compensated by the activity of GLI2 and related factors. ANIMAL MODEL Grachtchouk et al. (2000) showed that transgenic mice overexpressing Gli2 in cutaneous keratinocytes develop multiple basal cell carcinomas (BCCs). These results established Gli2 as a potent oncogene in skin and suggested a pivotal role for this transcription factor in the development of human BCC. Furthermore, they found that overexpression of Gli2 in skin results in the activation of multiple Sonic hedgehog target genes, a feature of human BCCs. They proposed that irrespective of the genetic alteration eliciting uncontrolled SHH signaling in human BCCs, GLI2 has a central role in the genesis of these tumors. Mill et al. (2003) found that Gli2-null mice showed grossly normal epidermal differentiation, but like Shh-null mice, they exhibited arrested hair follicle development with reduced cell proliferation and Shh-responsive gene expression. A constitutively active form of Gli2, but not wildtype Gli2, activated Shh-responsive gene expression and promoted cell proliferation in Shh-null skin.

comment: CLONING Like GLI2 (165230), the GLI3 gene was isolated by virtue of its cross-hybridization to the zinc finger gene GLI (165220), which is amplified in certain glioblastomas and represents a potential sequence-specific DNA-binding transcription factor from the GLI-Kruppel gene family. The GLI3 gene is expressed as an 8.5-kb mRNA in tissues such as testis, myometrium, placenta, and lung, and the protein product (relative molecular mass, 190,000) shows sequence-specific DNA binding (Ruppert et al., 1988; Ruppert et al., 1990). The gene encodes a predicted 1,596-amino acid polypeptide. GENE FUNCTION GLI3 is homologous to the Drosophila cubitus interruptus (ci) gene product (Ci), which regulates the patched (pct), gooseberry (gsb), and decapentaplegic (dpp) genes. Ci is sequestered in the cytoplasm and is subject to posttranslational processing whereby the full-length transcriptional activator form with 155 amino acids (Ci-155) can be cleaved to a repressor form with 75 amino acids (Ci-75). Under hedgehog (see 600725) signaling, Ci-155 translocates to the nucleus, whereas in the absence of hedgehog, Ci-75 translocates to the nucleus. Based on the correlation of GLI3 truncation mutations and the human phenotypes, Shin et al. (1999) hypothesized that GLI3 shows transcriptional activation or repression activity and subcellular localization similar to Ci. They showed that full-length GLI3 localizes to the cytoplasm and activates PTCH (601309) gene expression, which is similar to full-length Ci-155. Wang et al. (2000) demonstrated that PKA-dependent processing of vertebrate GLI3 in developing limb generates a potent repressor in a manner antagonized by apparent long-range signaling from posteriorly localized Sonic hedgehog protein (SHH; 600725). They concluded that the resulting anterior/posterior GLI3 repressor gradient can be perturbed by mutations of the GLI3 gene in human genetic syndromes or by misregulation of Gli3 processing in the chicken mutant talpid-2, producing a range of limb patterning malformations. The high relative abundance and potency of GLI3 repressor suggested specialization of GLI3 and its products for negative Hedgehog pathway regulation. GENE STRUCTURE Vortkamp et al. (1994) isolated a YAC contig of more than 1,000 kb, including the GLI3 gene. In this contig the gene itself spanned at least 200 to 250 kb. A CpG island was located in the vicinity of the 5-prime region of the GLI3 cDNA, implying a potential promoter region. Kang et al. (1997) demonstrated that the coding region of GLI3 is composed of 14 exons, including a large exon of more than 2,500 bp. In addition, the gene contains 2 intragenic dinucleotide repeats, and 4 single-bp polymorphisms in the coding region. Kang et al. (1997) used these coding region polymorphisms to design an allele-specific expression study useful for investigating patients with Greig syndrome (175700). MAPPING Ruppert et al. (1988) mapped the GLI3 gene to chromosome 7 by analysis of DNA from human-rodent hybrid panels. Using in situ hybridization, Ruppert et al. (1990) mapped the GLI3 gene to chromosome 7p13. MOLECULAR GENETICS See 165240.0001 for evidence that GLI3 is the site of the mutation responsible for Greig cephalopolysyndactyly syndrome (GCPS; 175700). Although GLI1, located on 12q13, has been associated with glioma, GLI3 has not been related to glioma or other form of neoplasia (Vogelstein, 1994). Large deletions or translocations resulting in haploinsufficiency of the GLI3 gene have been found in association with GCPS (Pettigrew et al., 1991; Vortkamp et al., 1991; Brueton et al., 1988), although no mutations were identified in GCPS patients with normal karyotypes. Kang et al. (1997) identified frameshift mutations in the GLI3 gene (e.g., 165240.0002) in Pallister-Hall syndrome (PHS; 146510). Postaxial polydactyly type A1 (PAPA1; 174200) is an autosomal trait characterized by an extra digit in the ulnar and/or fibular side of the upper and/or lower extremities. The extra digit is usually functional, since it is well formed and articulates with the fifth or extrametacarpal/metatarsal. The gene responsible for this trait was mapped to the centromeric region of 7p by Radhakrishna et al. (1997). Since the GLI3 gene maps to the same region, Radhakrishna et al. (1997) performed a mutation search in GLI3 cDNA from an Indian family with PAPA1 and demonstrated a mutation at codon 764 in 1 GLI3 allele. The mutation occurred 3-prime to the conserved domain termed Pzf1 (post zinc finger-1). Haploinsufficiency GLI3 is associated with some cases of GCPS, while frameshift mutations 3-prime to the zinc finger domains but upstream of the Pzf1 domain cause the Pallister-Hall syndrome. Thus, the coding of presumably different truncated GLI3 proteins are associated with different clinical syndromes, suggesting specific roles for the variant protein domains during development. For a review of the role of this gene in limb development, see Johnson and Tabin (1997). Shin et al. (1999) found that the mutant GLI3 protein of the Pallister-Hall syndrome localizes to the nucleus and represses GLI3-activated PTCH expression, which is similar to Ci-75. The mutant protein of Greig cephalopolysyndactyly syndrome has no effect on GLI3-activated PTCH transcription, consistent with the role of haploinsufficiency in this disorder. The mutant GLI3 protein of type A1 postaxial polysyndactyly showed less specific subcellular localization but still inhibited GLI3-activated PTCH transcription, suggesting that it may be a weaker allele than the Pallister-Hall mutation. These data showed that GLI3 mutations in human mimic the functional effects of the Drosophila ci gene and correlate with the distinct effects of these mutations on human development. Kalff-Suske et al. (1999) performed GLI3 mutation analysis on 24 additional GCPS cases. They identified 15 novel mutations present in heterozygous state in the patients' GLI3 alleles. The mutations mapped throughout the coding gene regions. Most were truncating mutations (9 of 15) that engendered prematurely terminated protein products mostly but not exclusively N-terminally to or within the central region encoding the DNA-binding domain. The 5 mutations identified within the protein regions C-terminal to the zinc fingers putatively affected additional functional properties of GLI3. In cell transfection experiments using fusions of the DNA-binding domain of yeast GAL4 to different segments of GLI3, transactivating capacity was assigned to 2 adjacent independent domains in the C-terminal third of GLI3. Since these were the only functional domains affected by 3 C-terminally truncating mutations, Kalff-Suske et al. (1999) postulated that GCPS may be due either to the haploinsufficiency resulting from complete loss of 1 gene copy, or to functional haploinsufficiency related to compromised properties of this transcription factor, such as DNA binding and transactivation. Kalff-Suske et al. (1999) provided a summary of known GLI3 mutations in GCPS, PHS, and PAPA1. Up to 1999, mutations in the GLI3 gene had been identified in Greig cephalopolysyndactyly, Pallister-Hall syndrome, and postaxial polydactyly type A. Radhakrishna et al. (1999) demonstrated a 1-nucleotide frameshift insertion (165240.0005) resulting in a truncated protein of 1,245 amino acids in a family with preaxial polydactyly type IV (174700). They found a frameshift mutation due to a 1-nucleotide deletion (165240.0007) in affected members of a family with dominant postaxial polydactyly type A/B (with type A and type B in the same family). In 2 other families with a mixed form of postaxial polydactyly, a nonsense mutation (R643X; 165240.0008) was found in one and a missense mutation (G727R; 165240.0009) in the other. A patient with Pallister-Hall syndrome had a nonsense mutation (E1147X; 165240.0006). These results added 2 phenotypes to the phenotypic spectrum caused by GLI3 mutations: the combined PAP-A/B and PPD-IV. Phenotype could not be predicted from the position of the GLI3 mutations. Radhakrishna et al. (1999) proposed that all phenotypes associated with GLI3 mutations be called 'GLI3 morphopathies,' since the phenotypic borders of the resulting syndromes are not well defined and there is no apparent genotype-phenotype correlation. Numerous fragments of mitochondrial DNA migrated from the mitochondrial genome to the nuclear genome over evolutionary time (Wallace et al., 1997; Mourier et al., 2001; Tourmen et al., 2002; Woischnik and Moraes, 2002). Mitochondrial DNA insertion polymorphisms can be used for human population studies (Thomas et al., 1996). This process of mitochondria-to-nucleus DNA migration has the consequence that the extant mitochondrial proteome is now overwhelmingly encoded by the nuclear genome. Turner et al. (2003) described a sporadic case of Pallister-Hall syndrome in which a de novo mitochondrial-nuclear translocation resulted in functional disruption of the GLI3 gene (165240.0011). Acrocallosal syndrome (ACLS; 200990) is characterized by postaxial polydactyly, hallux duplication, macrocephaly, and absence of the corpus callosum, usually with severe developmental delay. The condition overlaps with that of GCPS, which results from mutation in the GLI3 gene. In a child with agenesis of the corpus callosum and severe retardation, both cardinal features of ACLS and rare in GCPS, Elson et al. (2002) identified a mutation in the GLI3 gene (165240.0013). As GLI3 had been excluded as the site of mutation in some cases of ACLS, and possible mapping of ACLS to 12p had been reported, the authors suggested that ACLS may be a heterogeneous group of disorders that, in some cases, result from mutation in GLI3 and represent a severe, allelic form of GCPS. Johnston et al. (2005) hypothesized that GLI3 mutations that predict a truncated functional repressor protein cause Pallister-Hall syndrome, whereas haploinsufficiency of GLI3 causes Greig cephalopolysyndactyly syndrome. To test this hypothesis, they screened 46 patients with PHS and 89 patients with GCPS for GLI3 mutations. They detected 47 pathologic mutations (among 60 probands), and when these mutations were combined with previously published mutations, 2 genotype-phenotype correlations were evident. GCPS was caused by many types of alterations, including translocations, large deletions, exonic deletions and duplications, small in-frame deletions, and missense, frameshift/nonsense, and splicing mutations. In contrast, PHS was caused only by frameshift/nonsense and splicing mutations. Among the frameshift/nonsense mutations, Johnston et al. (2005) found a clear genotype/phenotype correlation. Mutations in the first third of the gene (from open reading frame nucleotides 1-1997) caused GCPS, and mutations in the second third of the gene (from nucleotides 1998-3481) caused primarily PHS. Surprisingly, there were 12 mutations in patients with GCPS in the 3-prime third of the gene (after open reading frame nucleotide 3481), and no patients with PHS had mutations in this region. These results demonstrated a robust genotype/phenotype correlation for GLI3 mutations and strongly supported the hypothesis that these 2 allelic disorders have distinct modes of pathogenesis. ANIMAL MODEL Litingtung et al. (2002) reported genetic analyses in mice showing that Shh and Gli3 are dispensable for formation of limb skeletal elements. The limbs of double-knockout Shh/Gli mice are distally complete and polydactylous, but completely lack wildtype digit identities. Litingtung et al. (2002) showed that the effects of Shh signaling on skeletal patterning and ridge maintenance are necessarily mediated through Gli3. The authors proposed that the function of Shh and Gli3 in limb skeletal patterning is limited to refining autopodial morphology, imposing pentadactyl constraint on the limb's polydactyl potential, and organizing digit identity specification, by regulating the relative balance of Gli3 transcriptional activator and repressor activities. Te Welscher et al. (2002) reported that the polydactyly of Gli3-deficient mice arises independently of Shh signaling. Disruption of one or both Gli3 alleles in mouse embryos lacking Shh progressively restored limb distal development and digit formation. Te Welscher et al. (2002) concluded that SHH signaling counteracts GLI3-mediated repression of key regulator genes, cell survival, and distal progression of limb bud development. The limbs of Gli3-deficient embryos were polydactylous, whereas 1 fused forearm bone and no digit arch formed in limbs of Shh-deficient embryos. Disruption of 1 Gli3 allele on an Shh-knockout background resulted in embryos with 2 forearm bones and rudimentary digits. The limbs of double homozygous mouse embryos were grossly morphologically indistinguishable from the limbs of Gli3 homozygous embryos. Te Welscher et al. (2002) showed that, whereas the polydactyly of Gli3 -/- mice is Shh-independent, the polydactyly of Alx4 (605420) mutant mice depends on Shh signaling. Bose et al. (2002) produced transgenic mice homozygous for a mutation lying 3-prime to the zinc finger DNA-binding domain of Gli3. These mice, which died shortly after birth, exhibited central polydactyly as well as a wide range of developmental abnormalities encompassing almost all of the common PHS features, including imperforate anus; gastrointestinal, epiglottis, and larynx defects; abnormal kidney development; and absence of adrenal glands. TUNEL assays revealed a decrease in apoptosis within the interdigital webs of these animals, although MSX2 (123101) expression, which is also involved in this process, was apparently not affected. Barna et al. (2005) identified a genetic interaction between Gli3 and Plzf (176797) that is required specifically at very early stages of limb development for all proximal cartilage condensations in the hindlimb (femur, tibia, fibula). Notably, distal condensations comprising the foot were relatively unperturbed in Gli3/Plzf double knockout mouse embryos. Barna et al. (2005) demonstrated that the cooperative activity of Gli3 and Plzf establishes the correct temporal and spatial distribution of chondrocyte progenitors in the proximal limb bud independently of proximal-distal (P-D) patterning markers and overall limb bud size. Moreover, the limb defects in the double knockout embryos correlated with the transient death of a specific subset of proximal mesenchymal cells that express bone morphogenetic protein receptor type 1B (Bmpr1b; 603248) at the onset of limb development. Barna et al. (2005) concluded that development of proximal and distal skeletal elements is distinctly regulated during early limb bud formation. The initial division of the vertebrate limb into 2 distinct molecular domains is consistent with fossil evidence indicating that the upper and lower extremities of the limb have different evolutionary origins.

comment: A number sign (#) is used with this entry because of evidence that otofaciocervical syndrome can be caused by a contiguous gene deletion involving the EYA1 gene (601653), mutations in which cause the branchiootorenal syndrome (BOR; 113650). A point mutation in the EYA1 gene has also been described as the cause of this disorder. CLINICAL FEATURES This syndrome was described by Fara et al. (1967) in a man and 4 of his 7 children. The otologic features were conductive hearing loss and prominent auricles with large conchae and preauricular fistulas just in front of the helix. Lateral cervical fistulas were present in some. Sunken nasal root, narrow nose, and long face were striking. The neck appeared long with sloping shoulders, low-set clavicles, and winged scapulas. All showed a mild intellectual deficit. This is the only known kindred (Gorlin, 1982). It is not clear that this entity is separate from one of those described elsewhere under 113600, 125100 or 128700. Dallapiccola and Mingarelli (1995) presented a sporadic case which they suggested supports the distinctness of the otofaciocervical syndrome. Distinguishing features were a long face with narrow nose, high arched palate, prominent and dysmorphic ears, long neck, sloping shoulders and clavicles, winged, low and laterally set scapulae, tetralogy of Fallot, and deafness secondary to cochlea malformation. Several features present in the original family, including lateral cervical fistulae, had suggested that otofaciocervical syndrome is a variant of BOR syndrome. The absence of preauricular tags, lacrimal duct stenosis, and renal malformations, and the presence of distinct facial and radiographic findings and markedly downward sloping shoulders in their patient led Dallapiccola and Mingarelli (1995) to suggest that the syndrome is a unique, clinically recognizable entity. Rickard et al. (2001) presented evidence that the otofaciocervical (OFC) syndrome is a contiguous gene deletion syndrome involving the EYA1 gene, which is the site of mutations causing the branchiootorenal syndrome. One of the 2 patients they studied had been previously reported by Rajput et al. (1999). She presented with moderate hearing loss, bilateral preauricular pits, a single lacrimal duct, a cup-shaped ear, and unilateral facial palsy. A congenital cholesteatoma was identified in her right middle ear and was treated surgically. She was of short stature and had a short neck and pronounced sloping shoulders, with limited shoulder abduction. X-rays showed lateral displaced scapulae. She had mild developmental delay. A renal ultrasound showed a small left kidney and a right kidney of normal size with a bifid pelvis. Both parents were unaffected and intellectually normal. MOLECULAR GENETICS Estefania et al. (2005) described a patient with the OFC syndrome who had a change of the first nucleotide in intron 6 of the EYA1 gene from guanine to adenine (540+1G-A; 601653.0014). The patient, who was 29 years old at the time of report, had bilateral conductive hearing loss and multiple malformations that led to the diagnosis of OFC dysplasia. Chest x-ray showed diastasis of the right sternoclavicular joint, and urography demonstrated bilateral sponge kidneys. The patient had a long and narrow face, preauricular and cervical pits, prominent and cupped ears, a high arched palate, sloping shoulders and clavicles, and trapezius hypoplasia which allowed adduction of the shoulders. Possibly unrelated to the syndrome, the patient had a selective deficiency of IgA.

comment: CLINICAL FEATURES Jackson and Apostolides (1978) described a family in which the mother and 3 of her 4 children had annular pancreas causing duodenal stenosis. In all 4, symptoms of high intestinal obstruction developed early in life and necessitated gastrojejunostomy or duodenojejunostomy. MacFadyen and Young (1987) described affected mother and son, both of whom presented in the neonatal period with gastrointestinal obstruction. The mother had undergone laparotomy at age 3 days. The son likewise was operated on at age 3 days. The descending duodenum was found to be stenotic in association with an annular pancreas. Montgomery et al. (1971) described an affected sib pair; however, since annular pancreas may be silent or present only in adult life, this does not necessarily represent recessive inheritance. It appears that no male-to-male transmission has been reported. Hendricks and Sybert (1991) described annular pancreas and duodenal obstruction in mother and daughter. Rogers et al. (1993) observed annular pancreas in a mother and daughter. Claviez et al. (1995), like Montgomery et al. (1971), described annular pancreas in sibs. The pregnancy in each of 2 sisters was complicated by polyhydramnios that was drained. Intestinal obstruction was suspected from prenatal ultrasound studies. In both sisters laparotomy was performed at day 3 of life with confirmation of the diagnosis of annular pancreas. Duodenostomy was performed, followed by uneventful recovery. ANIMAL MODEL Homozygous inactivation of the Indian hedgehog gene (IHH; 600726) in mice results in 42% annular pancreas (Hebrok et al., 2000), and inactivation of the Shh gene (SHH; 600725) in mice also leads to annular pancreas in certain genetic backgrounds (Ramalho-Santos et al., 2000). Gut malrotations and imperforate anus, often associated with annular pancreas in humans, are also found in Shh mutant mice.

comment: CLONING Primates are susceptible to poliomyelitis infection, but rodents are not; furthermore, human cells but not rodent cells are killed by poliovirus in vitro. Susceptibility to poliovirus is a function of the presence or absence of a cellular receptor to which the virus binds as the first step in poliovirus replication. The poliovirus receptors are members of the immunoglobulin superfamily. Mendelsohn et al. (1986) succeeded in transforming a human poliovirus receptor gene into mouse L cells which are ordinarily resistant to poliovirus infection because they do not bear a poliovirus receptor. Monoclonal antibody directed against the HeLa cell poliovirus receptor site was used in rosette assays to identify poliovirus-sensitive transformants. Mendelsohn et al. (1989) and Koike et al. (1990) isolated genomic and complementary DNAs for human poliovirus receptors (PVRs) from HeLa cells. Four mRNA isoforms, 2 membrane-bound and 2 secreted, were identified and shown to be generated by alternative splicing from the primary transcript. The PVRs are members of the immunoglobulin superfamily. Shepley et al. (1988) prepared a monoclonal antibody that identified a 100-kD membrane protein in HeLa cells and in human spinal cord involved in poliovirus attachment. They showed that the antigen identified by the monoclonal antibody was associated with the presence of human chromosome 19 in human-mouse hybrid cell lines. The monoclonal antibodies stained neurons in the reticular formation and clusters of brainstem neurons, consistent with the known pattern of damage caused by poliovirus infection in the brainstem. Furthermore, it reacted with human peripheral mononuclear cells, consistent with the known replication of poliovirus in Peyer patches and tonsils. GENE FUNCTION By analysis of transgenic mice expressing human CD155, Gromeier et al. (2000) observed expression of CD155 within embryonic structures giving rise to spinal cord anterior horn motor neurons. They suggested that this expression may explain the restrictive host cell tropism of poliovirus for this cellular compartment of the central nervous system. Solecki et al. (2002) noted that CD155 is aberrantly expressed in neuroectodermal tumors. RT-PCR analysis showed that SHH (600725) treatment of teratocarcinoma cells upregulates CDC155 and that this upregulation requires an intact GLI (165220)-binding site. The authors proposed that their finding might help explain the normal function of CD155 during development and its expression in tumors. Bottino et al. (2003) immunized mice with natural killer (NK)-susceptible human target cells and obtained antibodies to PVR and nectin-2 (PVRL2; 600798). Binding analysis and flow cytometry demonstrated that both molecules bound strongly with DNAM1 (CD226; 605397), but not with other activating NK receptors, including NKp46 (NCR1; 604530) and NKp30 (LY117; 109170). Expression of PVR or PVRL2 rendered cells susceptible to enhanced lysis in a DNAM1-dependent manner that was nearly abrogated in the presence of antibody to PVR, PVRL2, or DNAM1. Using flow cytometric analysis and fluorescence microscopy, Fuchs et al. (2004) demonstrated that NK cells recognize PVR through an additional receptor, CD96 (606037). CD96 promoted NK cell adhesion to target cells expressing PVR, stimulated cytotoxicity by activated NK cells, and mediated acquisition of PVR from target cells. By flow cytometric and immunohistochemical analysis, Reymond et al. (2004) found that PVR and nectin-2 were expressed at cell junctions on primary vascular endothelial cells. Binding of DNAM1 at endothelial junctions was abrogated by anti-PVR, but not by anti-nectin-2. Transmigration assays showed that either anti-PVR or anti-DNAM1 blocked monocyte transmigration through endothelium, with monocyte arrest at the apical surface of endothelium over intercellular junctions, suggesting that the DNAM1-PVR interaction occurs during diapedesis. Reymond et al. (2004) concluded that DNAM1 regulates monocyte extravasation via interaction with PVR. BIOCHEMICAL FEATURES - Crystal Structure He et al. (2000) determined the structure of the extracellular, 3-domain PVR/CD155 molecule complexed with poliovirus at 22-angstrom resolution. MAPPING In a study of human-mouse hybrids, Miller et al. (1974) showed that chromosome 19 is correlated with susceptibility to poliovirus. Siddique et al. (1985) regionalized the PVS gene to 19q13-qter. By the study of rodent/human hybrid cell lines carrying 4 different regions of human chromosome 19, Siddique et al. (1988) demonstrated that the typical cytopathic effects of poliovirus infection were observed only when the region 19q12-q13.2 was contained as the smallest region of overlap. The same region contains the gene for myotonic dystrophy (160900). The PVS gene is also of interest in connection with inherited motor neuron diseases because it encodes a cell-surface receptor expressed on motor neurons. Schonk et al. (1990) assigned the PVS gene to 19q13.2 by hybridization studies using a panel of somatic cell hybrids with subchromosomal segments of 19q. By fluorescence in situ hybridization, Trask et al. (1993) assigned the PVS gene to 19q13.2-q13.3. Seldin et al. (1991) mapped the homologous gene in the mouse to chromosome 9. ANIMAL MODEL Koike et al. (1991) noted that mouse L cells are not permissive for poliovirus infection. However, mouse L-cell transformants carrying the human PVS gene are permissive for infection of all 3 serotypes of poliovirus. This observation indicated that all 3 serotypes use the same cellular receptor and that mouse cells have the cellular machinery for poliovirus replication except for the receptor. Koike et al. (1991) created transgenic mice carrying the human PVS gene. They demonstrated sensitivity of the cells in the central nervous system of the transgenic mice to poliovirus and suggested that the transgenic mice may be an excellent animal model for studying the pathogenesis of polio and assessing poliovirus vaccines.

comment: DESCRIPTION A number sign (#) is used with this entry because of evidence that in at least some cases the Currarino triad is caused by mutation in a homeobox gene, HLXB9 (142994). Belloni et al. (2000) presented evidence that of the 5 specific categories of sacrococcygeal anomalies (Kalitzki, 1965; Cama et al., 1996), it is only the type IV form of caudal regression syndrome (CRS) characterized by hemisacrum that is caused by mutations in the HLXB9 gene. CLINICAL FEATURES The Currarino triad involves the association of partial sacral agenesis with intact first sacral vertebra ('sickle-shaped sacrum'), a presacral mass, and anorectal malformation (Currarino et al., 1981). The specific sacral anomaly is distinct to this syndrome. Of 10 affected members in the family reported by O'Riordain et al. (1991), only 4 were symptomatic, 3 of these had the full Currarino syndrome (sacral agenesis, presacral mass, and anorectal malformation), and the fourth had an anterior meningocele with no anorectal problems. All 10 had evidence of partial sacral agenesis on x-ray. Constipation and perianal sepsis are common complaints. Ascending infection resulting in E. coli bacterial meningitis has been reported. Associated malformations include rectovaginal fistula, tethering of the cord, duplex ureter, hydronephrosis, vesicoureteral reflux, bicornuate uterus, and neurogenic bladder. Malignant degeneration of the presacral teratoma has also been reported (Ashcraft and Holder, 1974 and Yates et al., 1983). Lynch et al. (2000) provided a review of the clinical features and molecular basis of Currarino syndrome. INHERITANCE Ashcraft and Holder (1974) obtained clear evidence of autosomal dominant inheritance in this condition which has variable expressivity. They described 2 families with 23 affected members. MAPPING Fellous et al. (1982) described a large French family where 5 of 15 affected members also had spina bifida aperta in association with sacral agenesis. They could find no evidence for linkage to the T-locus using HLA phenotyping. Chatkupt et al. (1994) excluded linkage to the HLA-locus in a large North American pedigree with 40 affected members. Lynch et al. (1995) demonstrated linkage at 7q36 in the families reported by O'Riordain et al. (1991) and Nour et al. (1989). The region 7q36 was considered a good candidate region because of several case reports describing sacral agenesis in association with 7q deletion. The gene maps to the same region as HPE3 (142945), a gene for autosomal dominant holoprosencephaly. Deletions involving 7q are also associated with holoprosencephaly suggesting that haploinsufficiency at this locus predisposes to both disorders. Both disorders are midline embryonic defects. The authors also pointed to the fact that the incidence of both disorders are increased in infants born to diabetic mothers. Lynch et al. (1995) suggested that these 2 conditions are possibly contiguous gene syndromes or even allelic variants. Lynch et al. (1995) obtained a maximum lod score of 4.38 at theta = 0.0 with marker D7S559. Nagai et al. (1994) described a Japanese male with typical Currarino triad who showed partial trisomy of 13q and 20p inherited from his mother, suggesting that the disorder may be heterogeneous and that a second locus may be present on 13q or 20p. CYTOGENETICS Wang et al. (1999) reported a family in which the presence of sacral dysgenesis in sibs and their maternal uncle prompted specific cytogenetic investigation of chromosome 7. Cytogenetic analysis showed that the mother of the 2 affected children carried a balanced translocation between chromosome 7q36 and 12q24. Both children were monosomic for 7q36, as they had inherited the deleted chromosome 7 from their mother. MOLECULAR GENETICS Ross et al. (1998) demonstrated mutations in the homeobox gene HLXB9 (142994) as the cause of the Currarino syndrome. In the families they studied, some individuals had the typical scimitar, or sickle-shaped, hemisacrum but were asymptomatic, whereas others had the full Currarino syndrome. Hagan et al. (2000) identified mutations in the HLXB9 gene in 20 of 21 patients with familial Currarino syndrome and in 2 of 7 patients with sporadic Currarino syndrome. In 3 of the patients, pathogenesis was due to a microdeletion that encompassed HLXB9 in the D7S637-D7S594 interval. All 3 of the microdeletion patients also had developmental delay, and 1 of them had a single maxillary incisor, a feature associated with holoprosencephaly. Hagan et al. (2000) stated that FISH analysis of this patient revealed a deletion in the SHH gene (600725) as well. In affected members of a 3-generation family segregating Currarino syndrome, Urioste et al. (2004) identified a frameshift mutation in the HLXB9 gene (142994.0009). The mutation was identified in the proband, a 22-year-old male in whom malignant transformation of a presacral teratoma was observed, as well as in 8 other family members, 3 of whom were asymptomatic but were subsequently found to have presacral teratomas. Of 9 family members with the mutation, 7 had confirmed teratomas, 1 had a presacral 'tumor' removed 15 years previously, and 1 refused removal of a presacral mass. Only 2 affected members displayed the complete triad. GENOTYPE/PHENOTYPE CORRELATIONS Kochling et al. (2001) analyzed the genotype-phenotype correlation in 23 patients from 9 families with mutations in the homeobox gene HLXB9. Although 10 of the patients were asymptomatic, radiologic investigation revealed characteristic phenotypic features in all patients. The complete triad, consisting of a presacral mass, anorectal malformation, and sacral agenesis, was found only in 8 of the 23 patients. There was a remarkable variability of the sacral agenesis. A highly variable phenotype was seen within most families, and a detailed clinical investigation failed to identify any obvious genotype-phenotype correlation.

comment: From a human tumor cDNA library, Houssaint et al. (1990) isolated a gene encoding a putative receptor-like protein-tyrosine kinase that they called TK14. The amino acid sequence was closely related to that of the mouse protein bek (bacterially expressed kinase), and more distantly related to the sequences of a chicken basic fibroblast growth factor receptor (73% sequence homology) and its presumed human equivalent, the FLG protein (136350). Overexpression of the TK14 protein by transfection of COS-1 cells led to the appearance of new cell-surface binding sites for both acidic and basic fibroblast growth factors. Dionne et al. (1990) also cloned a complete cDNA for the human bek homolog (symbolized FGFR2). Keratinocyte growth factor (148180) has potent mitogenic activity for a wide variety of epithelial cells but lacks detectable activity on fibroblasts or endothelial cells. This synthesis by stromal fibroblasts in a large number of epithelial tissues suggests that KGF is an important paracrine mediator of normal epithelial cell proliferation. Furthermore, studies indicated specific KGF binding to keratinocytes but not fibroblasts. Miki et al. (1991) devised an expression cloning strategy to isolate cDNA for the keratinocyte growth factor receptor. The 4.2-kb cDNA was shown to encode a predicted membrane-spanning tyrosine kinase related to, but distinct from, the basic FGF receptor. The fibroblast growth factor receptors comprise a family of related but individually distinct tyrosine kinase receptors. They have a similar protein structure, with 3 immunoglobulin-like domains in the extracellular region, a single membrane spanning segment, and a cytoplasmic tyrosine kinase domain. The other fibroblast growth factor receptors that have been identified are FGFR1 (136350); FGFR3 (134934), which is mutant in achondroplasia (100800); and FGFR4 (134935). Sequence analysis of the 4.5-kb human FGFR2 gene shows an open reading frame encoding the typical membrane-spanning, tyrosine kinase receptor structure of the FGFR gene family. Two alternative gene products have been characterized: KGFR and BEK. These 2 isoforms are identical except for a 49-amino acid sequence spanning the second half of the third Ig loop in the extracellular region. This local diversity is due to the presence of alternative exons within FGFR2, exon B being expressed in the BEK product and exon K26 in KGFR. Control of these alternative splice sites is thought to involve transacting factors (Gilbert et al., 1993). The variation in expressed gene product is highly significant because the ligand-binding characteristics of KGFR and BEK are quite distinct. Furthermore, they have different patterns of expression in murine embryogenesis. Whereas KGFR appears to have a role in skin development, BEK is preferentially expressed in osteogenesis. BEK transcripts are concentrated in the frontal bones, maxilla, mandibula, and ossicles of the middle ear. To elucidate the structural determinants governing specificity in FGF signaling, Plotnikov et al. (2000) determined the crystal structures of FGF1 (131220) and FGF2 (134920) complexed with the immunoglobulin-like ligand-binding domains 2 and 3 (D2 and D3) of FGFR1 and FGFR2, respectively. They found that highly conserved FGF-D2 and FGF-linker (between D2 and D3) interfaces define a general binding site for all FGF-FGFR complexes. Specificity is achieved through interactions between the N-terminal and central regions of FGFs and 2 loop regions in D3 that are subject to alternative splicing. These structures provide a molecular basis for FGF1 as a universal FGFR ligand and for modulation of FGF-FGFR specificity through primary sequence variations and alternative splicing. Pellegrini et al. (2000) reported the crystal structure of the FGFR2 ectodomain in a dimeric form that is induced by simultaneous binding to FGF1 and a heparin decasaccharide. The complex is assembled around a central heparin molecule linking 2 FGF1 ligands into a dimer that bridges between 2 receptor chains. The asymmetric heparin binding involves contacts with both FGF1 molecules but only one receptor chain. The structure of the FGF1-FGFR2-heparin ternary complex provides a structural basis for the essential role of heparan sulfate in FGF signaling. Mattei et al. (1991) used a 2.3-kb cDNA probe from the human BEK fibroblast growth factor receptor to determine localization of the gene on 10q26 by in situ hybridization. Dionne et al. (1992) assigned the BEK gene to chromosome 10 by applying PCR techniques to DNAs from a panel of human/rodent somatic cell hybrids. They further localized the gene to 10q25.3-q26 by in situ hybridization. Using an interspecific backcross mapping panel, Avraham et al. (1994) mapped the murine equivalent to chromosome 7. Because of the clear importance of BEK expression in osteogenesis and the localization of FGFR2 to the same chromosomal region as the mutation responsible for Crouzon syndrome (CFD1; 123500), FGFR2 became a candidate gene for the clinical disorder. Reardon et al. (1994) found SSCP variations in the B exon of FGFR2 in 9 unrelated affected individuals as well as complete cosegregation between SSCP variation and disease in 3 unrelated multigeneration families. In 4 sporadic cases, the unaffected parents did not have SSCP variation. Direct sequencing revealed specific mutations in the B exon in all 9 sporadic and familial cases, including replacement of a cysteine in an immunoglobulin-like domain in 5 patients. In only 9 out of 20 patients with Crouzon syndrome did Reardon et al. (1994) find mutations in the FGFR2 gene. There was, however, no evidence for genetic heterogeneity either in a previously published linkage report (Preston et al., 1994) or in the new data. It was thought likely that mutations in other areas of the FGFR2 gene were responsible for the cases yet to be explained. Jabs et al. (1994) demonstrated mutations in the FGFR2 gene in patients with Crouzon syndrome as well as in patients with Jackson-Weiss syndrome (JWS; 123150). Wilkie et al. (1995) found mutations in the FGFR2 gene in Apert syndrome (101200). In all 40 unrelated cases of Apert syndrome studied, they identified specific missense substitutions involving adjacent amino acids (ser252-to-trp, 176943.0010 and pro253-to-arg, 176943.0011) in the linker between the second and third extracellular immunoglobulin (Ig) domains of FGFR2. The first of these mutations was caused by a C-to-G transversion at position 934 of the cDNA. The second was caused by a C-to-G transversion at position 937. Jabs et al. (1994) referred to these as the type 1 and type 2 mutations, respectively. The 934C-G mutation arose in a CpG dinucleotide, whereas the 937C-G mutation did not. The fact that they did not observe any 934C-T mutations (ser252-to-leu) suggested that this would give a phenotype different from that of Apert syndrome. Wilkie et al. (1995) found the type 1 mutation in 25 of the patients and the type 2 mutation in 15. In 3 patients, the parental origin of new mutations was established to be the father. In a larger series of 118 unrelated cases of Apert syndrome studied in Oxford, Moloney et al. (1996) found that 74 had the 934C-G mutation and 44 had the 937C-G mutation. Combined with the cases reported by Park et al. (1995), the total experience indicated that 108 of 166 cases (65%) were of the 934C-G type, 57 of 166 cases (34%) were of the 937C-G type, and 1 case observed by Park et al. (1995) was of unknown mutational basis. Wilkie (1996) observed paternal age effect with both Apert mutations in 54 informative families; the mutation was of paternal origin in all cases. Limb malformation seemed to be more severe in the 937C-G mutation; cleft palate was more often present, and craniofacial abnormality was in general more severe with the 934C-G mutation (Wilkie, 1996). Indeed, the severe craniofacial abnormality and cleft palate in association with milder involvement of the hands gave rise to the designation of Vogt cephalodactyly or Apert-Crouzon disease for the condition in the cases described by Vogt (1933) combining the hand and foot malformations characteristic of Apert disease with the facial characteristics of Crouzon disease; see 101200. Lajeunie et al. (1995) and Rutland et al. (1995) found mutations in the FGFR2 gene in some patients with Pfeiffer syndrome (101600). In the instance of some mutations, the disorder was Pfeiffer syndrome in some families and Crouzon syndrome in others. Thus, mutations in the FGFR2 gene may result in any one of several different phenotypes. The clinical criteria of Pfeiffer syndrome, particularly interphalangeal ankylosis, are thought to be distinctive (Lajeunie et al., 1995). There is no confusion of Pfeiffer syndrome with Crouzon syndrome, in which no hand anomalies and occasional radial-ulnar synostosis have been reported, or with Jackson-Weiss syndrome, which includes a tarsal-metatarsal coalescence and a medial deviation of broad great toes. The occurrence of different phenotypes with the same mutation may reflect the presence on the same chromosome of a particular change elsewhere in the gene. This would be comparable to the asp178-to-asn mutation in the prion protein gene (176640), which results in familial fatal insomnia (600072) when the amino acid at position 129 is methionine, and in Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease (123400) when the amino acid at position 129 is valine. We are reminded by Mulvihill (1995) that in statistical parlance, some clinical diagnoses of syndromes of multiple malformations are more like confidence intervals than point estimates. He suggested further that permutation may be a better term than mutation. With over 100 craniosynostosis syndromes, 9 fibroblast growth factors, and 4 receptors for them, each with many overlapping and homologous regions, combination and permutation may lead to the inevitable failure of the one mutation-one disease model. In a study of 39 unrelated patients with Crouzon, Jackson-Weiss, or Pfeiffer syndrome, Meyers et al. (1996) demonstrated that in all 3 conditions mutations were located in exon IIIc. Only in Crouzon syndrome were mutations identified in exon IIIa. In all, 11 mutations were found in 17 unrelated cases. Steinberger et al. (1996) identified previously unrecognized mutations in each of 3 patients with Crouzon syndrome: a deletion, a duplication, and a point mutation. Steinberger et al. (1996) described an FGFR2 mutation (176943.0006) in a large family with autosomal dominant craniosynostosis with marked phenotypic variation and with clinical manifestations that were not classifiable as Apert, Crouzon, Pfeiffer, or Jackson-Weiss syndromes. The mutation detected in the family described by Steinberger et al. (1996) is identical to that described in a family with Crouzon syndrome by Reardon et al. (1994) and by Jabs et al. (1994). Wilkie et al. (1995) provided a useful resume of the 4 different systems that have been used for numbering exons in the FGFR genes and the cDNA nucleotide numbering system. Oldridge et al. (1997) stated that recurrent mutations of a serine-proline dipeptide (either ser252 to trp or pro253 to arg) had been identified in more than 160 unrelated individuals with Apert syndrome. They identified 3 novel mutations of this dipeptide associated with distinct phenotypes. The substitution ser252leu was demonstrated in a boy with mild Crouzon syndrome and was also present in 3 clinically normal members of his family. A CG-to-TT mutation that predicted a ser252-to-phe substitution (176943.0017) resulted in a phenotype consistent with Apert syndrome. Finally, a CGC-to-TCT mutation that predicted a double amino acid substitution (ser252 to phe and pro253 to ser; 176943.0018) caused a Pfeiffer syndrome variant with mild craniosynostosis, broad thumbs and big toes, fixed extension of several digits, and only minimal cutaneous syndactyly. The observation that the ser252-to-phe mutation causes Apert syndrome, whereas the other single or double substitutions are associated with milder or normal phenotypes, highlighted the exquisitely specific molecular pathogenesis of the limb and craniofacial abnormalities associated with Apert syndrome. Oldridge et al. (1997) stated that the substitution ser252 to phe was the first noncanonical mutation to be identified in Apert syndrome, its rarity being explained by the requirement for 2 residues of the serine codon to be mutated. The authors noted that they had previously demonstrated exclusive paternal origin of mutation in Apert syndrome in 57 of 57 cases, and suggested that the high apparent rates for several FGFR mutations could arise by a selective advantage conferred to the mutated male germ cell (Moloney et al., 1996). Consistent with this, there is evidence that the FGF/FGFR signaling pathway plays an important role in the initiation and maintenance of spermatogenesis (Van Dissel-Emiliani et al., 1996). Goriely et al. (2003) developed a sensitive method to quantify substitutions at nucleotide 755 of the FGFR2 gene, which lead to mutations in codon 252, in sperm. They measured mutation levels in samples from blood of 11 healthy individuals, sperm from 99 healthy men without a family history of Apert syndrome, and sperm from 6 unaffected fathers of children with Apert syndrome caused by the 755C-G mutation. Only low levels (less than 10(-5)) of all mutations were found in blood, which excluded the possibility that higher levels in sperm were caused by contamination or PCR artifacts. In sperm, the level of 755C-A never exceeded 6.3 x 10(-6) and showed no paternal age effects (r of -0.06; p of 0.71), but both 755C-G and 755C-T reached high levels (maxima of 1.6 x 10(-4) and 1.4 x 10(-4), respectively) that were positively correlated with donor age. The average level of 755C-G was 1.66-fold higher than that of 755C-T, which was statistically significant. Levels of the 755C-G mutation in the sperm of fathers of Apert syndrome children were also within the envelope of normal values, indicating that these men were sampled from the general population and had a very low risk of fathering another affected child. Further analyses led Goriely et al. (2003) to conclude that the major factor underlying the paternal age effect is not the accumulation of replication errors or insufficient repair processes, but positive selection of infrequent mutations acting over the course of time. They stated that the constancy of FGFR2 mutation levels over many months indicated that the mutations are present in spermatogonia with stem cell-like properties. Goriely et al. (2003) proposed that these FGFR2 mutations, although harmful to embryonic development, are paradoxically enriched because they confer selective advantage to the spermatogonial cells in which they arise. Glaser et al. (2003) studied the paternal age effect and the exclusive paternal origin of mutations reported in Apert syndrome. As the incidence of sporadic Apert syndrome births increases exponentially with paternal age, they hypothesized that the frequency of Apert syndrome mutations in sperm would also increase. They noted that 99% of sporadic cases of Apert syndrome are caused by 1 of 2 common mutations in the FGFR2 gene, S252W (176943.0010) or P253R (176943.0011), and developed allele-specific peptide nucleic acid PCR assays to determine the frequency of these 2 mutations. Analyzing sperm DNA from 148 men, aged 21 to 80 years, they showed that the number of sperm with mutations increased in the oldest age groups among men who did not have a child with Apert syndrome. These older men were also more likely to have both mutations in their sperm. However, this age-related increase in mutation frequency was not sufficient to explain the Apert syndrome birth frequency. In contrast, the mutation frequency observed in men who were younger and had children with Apert syndrome was significantly greater. The data suggested selection for sperm with specific mutations. Therefore, contributing factors to the paternal age effect may include selection and a higher number of mutant sperm in a subset of men ascertained because they had a child with Apert syndrome. No age-related increase in the frequency of these mutations was observed in leukocytes. Selection and/or quality control mechanisms, including DNA repair and apoptosis, may contribute to the cell type differences in mutation frequency. In a study of sporadic cases of Crouzon syndrome and Pfeiffer syndrome, Glaser et al. (2000) used 4 intragenic polymorphisms to screen a total of 41 families. Of these, 22 (11 for each syndrome) were informative. They found 11 different mutations in the 22 families. By molecular means they proved that the origin of these different mutations was paternal in all informative cases analyzed. Advanced paternal age was noted for the fathers of patients with Crouzon syndrome or Pfeiffer syndrome, compared with the fathers of control individuals (34.50 +/- 7.65 years vs 30.45 +/- 1.28 years, P less than 0.01). The data extended previous information on advanced paternal age for sporadic FGFR2 mutations causing Apert syndrome and FGFR3 mutations causing achondroplasia. In a screening of 14 patients with craniosynostosis syndromes known to be related to FGFR2, Hollway et al. (1997) looked for mutations in exons IIIa and IIIc of FGFR2. They found 9 mutations, 8 of which had been previously reported. One patient with Pfeiffer syndrome was found to have a novel mutation. Tartaglia et al. (1997) reported a de novo G-to-C transversion in exon IIIa of the FGFR2 gene, detected in a patient with severe Pfeiffer clinical features (176943.0019). Missense mutations at codon 290 of FGFR2 had been reported previously in Crouzon syndrome, but not in Pfeiffer syndrome. Codon 290 appears to be a mutation hotspot in the FGFR2 gene. A trp290-to-arg substitution results in classic Crouzon syndrome (Meyers et al., 1996), whereas trp290 to gly results in an atypically mild form of Crouzon syndrome (Park et al., 1995). Steinberger et al. (1998) reviewed the reported FGFR2 mutations associated with craniosynostoses and described 3 previously unrecognized mutations. They pointed out that the known mutations involved 5 distinct structural elements of the receptor. The changes within these elements affect receptor function by various mechanisms, including altered dimerization, truncation, increased mobility between Ig domains, disintegration of IgIII, and alteration of the ligand-binding site. An erratum for the article by Steinberger et al. (1998) included a new Table 2, which listed FGFR2 mutations found in craniosynostoses. Apert syndrome results from specific mutations at 2 adjacent residues of the FGFR2 gene, ser252 to trp (176943.0010) and pro253 to arg (176943.0011), predicted to lie in the linker region between IgII and IgIII regions of the portions of the FGFR2 ligand-binding domain. Anderson et al. (1998) analyzed the interaction of FGF ligands with wildtype and Apert-type mutant FGFR2 ectodomains in solution. Wildtype and Apert-type receptors form a complex with FGF ligands with a stoichiometry of 2:2 (ligand:receptor). The kinetics and specificity of ligand binding to wildtype and Apert mutant receptors were analyzed using surface plasmon resonance techniques. Anderson et al. (1998) found that Apert mutations, compared with wildtype, exhibited a selective decrease in the dissociation kinetics of FGF2, but not of other FGF ligands examined. In contrast, the substitution ser252 to leu in FGFR2, previously observed in several asymptomatic individuals, exhibited wildtype kinetics. These findings indicate that Apert syndrome arises as a result of increased affinity of mutant receptors for specific FGF ligands which leads to activation of signaling under conditions where availability of ligand is limiting. Apert syndrome is commonly accompanied by acne. Munro and Wilkie (1998), cognizant of this and with unifying insight, studied a patient who was well except for acne, which was present in the pattern described by Blaschko in the 19th century (Jackson, 1976). In this pattern, abnormality of the skin is limited to a linear or whirled pattern. Commonly misinterpreted as dermatomal, the pattern, and therefore the mechanism, is quite distinct. This was interpreted by Shuster (1978) as representing the clonal pattern of movement of cells during development. Munro and Wilkie (1998) reasoned that if a germline defect in FGFR2 causes acne in the context of Apert syndrome, a mutation confined to epidermal cells (because it had arisen during development) might produce acne in the pattern described by Blaschko. They showed that one of the common FGFR2 mutations in Apert syndrome, a ser252-to-trp substitution, is present in the abnormal but not the normal skin. Passos-Bueno et al. (1999) provided an up-to-date listing of the mutations in FGFR1, FGFR2, and FGFR3 associated with distinct clinical entities, including achondroplasia (100800), hypochondroplasia (146000), platyspondylic lethal skeletal dysplasia (see 151210 and 270230), thanatophoric dysplasia (see 187600 and 187601), Antley-Bixler syndrome (207410), Apert syndrome (101200), Beare-Stevenson syndrome (123790), Crouzon syndrome (123500), Jackson-Weiss syndrome (123150), Pfeiffer syndrome (101600), and Saethre-Chotzen syndrome (101400). Yu et al. (2000) demonstrated that the mutations in 2 adjacent amino acid residues that cause Apert syndrome, S252W (176943.0010) and P253R (176943.0011), break one of the cardinal rules governing ligand specificity of FGFR2. They are located in the highly conserved region linking Ig-like domains II and III of FGFR2. Yu et al. (2000) showed that the S252W mutation allows the mesenchymal splice form of FGFR2 (FGFR2c) to bind and to be activated by the mesenchymally expressed ligands FGF7 (148180) or FGF10 (602115) and the epithelial splice form of FGFR2 (FGFR2b) to be activated by FGF2 (134920), FGF6 (134921), and FGF9 (600921). The data demonstrated loss of ligand specificity of FGFR2 with retained ligand dependence for receptor activation. The data suggested that the severe phenotypes of Apert syndrome likely result from ectopic ligand-dependent activation of FGFR2. Of 260 cases of Apert syndrome studied by Oldridge et al. (1999), 2 did not have missense mutations in the FGFR2 gene but rather de novo Alu insertions upstream or within exon 9 of FGFR2 (176943.0025). To elucidate the mechanism by which 2 activating mutations in FGFR2, ser252 to trp (176943.0010) and pro253 to arg (176943.0011), cause Apert syndrome, Ibrahimi et al. (2001) determined the crystal structures of these 2 FGFR2 mutants in complex with fibroblast growth factor-2 (FGF2). These structures demonstrate that both mutations introduce additional interactions between FGFR2 and FGF2, thereby augmenting FGFR2-FGF2 affinity. Moreover, based on these structures and the sequence alignment of the FGF family, they proposed that the pro253-to-arg mutation will indiscriminately increase the affinity of FGFR2 toward any FGF. In contrast, the ser252-to-trp mutation will selectively enhance the affinity of FGFR2 toward a limited subset of FGFs. These predictions are consistent with previous biochemical data describing the effects of Apert syndrome mutations on FGF binding. The distinct gain-of-function interactions observed in each crystal structure provide a model to explain the phenotypic variability among Apert syndrome patients. For example, patients with the ser252-to-trp mutation present more frequently with cleft palate, whereas patients with the pro253-to-arg mutation exhibit more severe syndactyly (Slaney et al., 1996; Lajeunie et al., 1999). Most mutations in Crouzon, Pfeiffer, and Apert syndromes occur in the extracellular third Ig-like domain and adjacent linker regions (exons IIIa and IIIc) of the FGFR2 gene. Wong et al. (2001) pointed out that an error in molecular diagnosis of craniosynostosis syndrome can result from a single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) located in the commonly used primer site. They reported patients who appeared to be homozygous for particular mutations because of this polymorphism, which they determined to have a frequency of 3% in the general population. To study the apparent clustering of mutations in the IgIII region of FGFR2, Kan et al. (2002) screened 259 patients with craniosynostosis in whom mutations in other genes, such as FGFR1, FGFR3, and TWIST (601622), had been excluded. Unbiased estimates of the mutation distribution were permitted because part of the screen was a cohort-based study. Although most of the FGFR2 mutations in the cohort sample (61 of 62) were localized to the IIIa and IIIc exons, Kan et al. (2002) identified mutations in 7 additional exons, including 6 distinct mutations in the tyrosine kinase region and a single mutation in the IgII domain. Most of the patients with atypical mutations had diagnoses of Pfeiffer syndrome or Crouzon syndrome. Overall, FGFR2 mutations were present in 9.8% of patients with craniosynostosis who were included in the prospectively ascertained sample, but no mutations were found in association with isolated fusion of the metopic or sagittal sutures. Kan et al. (2002) concluded that the spectrum of FGFR2 mutations causing craniosynostosis is wider than previously recognized but that the IgIIIa/IIIc region represents a genuine mutation hotspot. In an extensive review of the genetics of craniofacial development and malformation, Wilkie and Morriss-Kay (2001) provided a useful diagram of the molecular pathways in cranial suture development with a listing of all craniofacial disorders caused by mutations in the corresponding genes. Four proteins were indicated as having strong evidence for existing in the pathway, with successive downstream targets as follows: TWIST--FGFR2--FGFR1--CBFA1 (600211). Warren et al. (2003) demonstrated that Noggin (602991) is expressed postnatally in the suture mesenchyme of patent, but not of fusing, cranial sutures, and that Noggin expression is suppressed by FGF2 and syndromic FGFR signaling. Warren et al. (2003) studied the effects of Apert (S252W; 176943.0010) and Crouzon (see C342Y; 176943.0001) syndrome Fgfr2 gain-of-function mutations on Noggin production in dural cell and osteoblast cultures. Both Apert and Crouzon syndrome Fgfr2 mutants markedly downregulated Noggin protein production in sagittal dura mater. The Apert and Crouzon Fgfr2 constructs also downregulated Bmp4 (112262)-induced Noggin expression in calvarial osteoblasts. Because both Apert and Crouzon syndrome Fgfr gain-of-function mutations promote pathologic suture fusion, Warren et al. (2003) concluded that their findings provide an important link between the murine models and the gain-of-function Fgfr mutations associated with syndromic Fgfr-mediated craniosynostoses. Warren et al. (2003) also showed that forced expression of Noggin maintained posterior frontal suture patency in mice. They suggested that since ectopic Noggin expression prevented the fusion of mouse posterior frontal sutures, it is possible that therapeutic Noggin could be exploited to control postnatal skeletal development. FGF-FGFR binding specificity is essential for mammalian development and is regulated primarily by 2 alternatively spliced exons, IIIb (b) and IIIc (c), that encode the second half of Ig-like domain 3 (D3) of FGFRs. FGF7 and FGF10 activate only the b isoform of FGFR2 (FGFR2b). Yeh et al. (2003) reported the crystal structure of the ligand-binding portion of FGFR2b bound to FGF10. Unique contacts between divergent regions of FGF10 and 2 b-specific loops in D3 revealed the structural basis by which alternative splicing provides FGF10-FGFR2b specificity. Structure-based mutagenesis of FGF10 confirmed the importance of the observed contacts for FGF10 biologic activity. FGF10 binding induced a previously unobserved rotation of receptor Ig domain 2 (D2) to introduce specific contacts with FGF10. Hence, both D2 and D3 of FGFR2b contribute to the exceptional specificity between FGF10 and FGFR2b. Yeh et al. (2003) proposed that ligand-induced conformational change in FGFRs may also play an important role in determining specificity for other FGF-FGFR complexes. Moore et al. (2004) studied the role of FGF and ephrin signaling in retina development in the frog. Activation of Fgfr2 signaling before gastrulation repressed cellular movements in the presumptive anterior neural plate and prevented normal retinal progenitor cells from adopting retinal fates. Ephrin B1 (300035) signaling during gastrulation was required for retinal progenitors to move into the eye field, and this movement could be modified by activating the FGF pathway. Moore et al. (2004) concluded that FGF modulation of ephrin signaling is important for establishing the bona fide retinal progenitors in the anterior neural plate. Zankl et al. (2004) noted that mutations in the FGFR2 gene cause a variety of craniosynostosis syndromes, and that most mutations had been found in either exon IIIa or IIIc or in the intronic sequence preceding exon IIIc. Mutations outside this hotspot were uncommon and the few identified mutations demonstrated wide clinical variability. McGillivray et al. (2005) identified a mutation in the FGFR2 gene (176943.0034) in a 3-generation family with a form of craniosynostosis characterized by scaphocephaly, maxillary retrusion, and mental retardation (609579). In a boy with scaphocephaly and an Axenfeld-Rieger anomaly, McCann et al. (2005) identified heterozygosity for an ala344-to-ala mutation in the FGFR2 gene (A344A; 176943.0006). The authors noted that severe ocular anterior chamber dysgenesis (Peters anomaly) had been previously described in 3 patients with severe craniosynostosis syndromes (see 176943.0024 and Okajima et al., 1999), and concluded that the FGFR2 gene has a role in anterior chamber embryogenesis. Lajeunie et al. (2006) screened 131 patients with clinical features of Apert, Crouzon, Pfeiffer, or Jackson-Weiss syndromes and identified mutations in FGFR1, FGFR2, or FGFR3 in 125 patients. The authors noted that 2 FGFR2 mutations creating cysteine residues, W290C (176943.0019) and Y340C, caused severe forms of Pfeiffer syndrome, whereas conversion of the same residues into another amino acid, W290R/W290G (176943.0021/176943.0022) or Y340H (176943.0004), resulted in the Crouzon phenotype exclusively. Lajeunie et al. (2006) concluded that the mutation spectrum of FGFR2 mutations in Crouzon and Pfeiffer syndromes is wider than originally thought, and that despite some overlap, Crouzon and Pfeiffer syndromes are preferentially accounted for by 2 distinct sets of FGFR2 mutations. ANIMAL MODEL Arman et al. (1998) found that disruption of the FGFR2 gene in mice resulted in a recessive embryonic lethal mutation. Preimplantation development was normal until the blastocyst stage. Homozygous mutant embryos died a few hours after implantation at a random position in the uterine crypt, with collapsed yolk cavity. Other observations indicated that FGFR2 is required for early postimplantation development between implantation and the formation of the egg cylinder. Arman et al. (1998) suggested that FGFR2 contributes to the outgrowth, differentiation, and maintenance of the inner cell mass and raised the possibility that this activity is mediated by FGF4 (164980) signals transmitted by FGFR2. Deng et al. (1997) showed by chimera experiments with homozygous mutant embryonic stem (ES) cells that Fgfr1 has a role in limb and central nervous system development. Involvement of Fgfr2 in limb outgrowth was indicated by a targeted mutation that displayed no limb buds but, because of placental insufficiency, did not survive beyond early limb outgrowth (Xu et al., 1998). Fgfr2 in the early embryo is expressed in the trophectoderm, and this extra-embryonic localization persists into mid- and late gestation, when Fgfr2 is also expressed in multiple developing organs. To gain insight into the later functions of Fgfr2, Arman et al. (1999) constructed fusion chimeras from homozygous mutant embryonic stem cells and wildtype tetraploid embryos. This allowed survival until term and revealed that Fgfr2 is required for both limb outgrowth and branching lung morphogenesis. The use of fusion chimeras demonstrated that early lethality was indeed because of trophectoderm defects and indicated that in the embryonic cell lineages Fgfr2 activity manifests in limb and lung development. Highly similar lung and limb phenotypes were detected in a loss-of-function mutation of Fgf10 (602115), a ligand of Fgfr2. It is likely, therefore, that whereas during early development Fgfr2 interacts with Fgf4, interactions between Fgf10 and Fgfr2 may be required in limb and lung development. In Fgf10 -/-, Fgfr2b -/-, and Sonic hedgehog (SHH; 600725) -/- mice, which all exhibit cleft palate, Rice et al. (2004) showed that Shh is a downstream target of Fgf10/Fgfr2b signaling. Using BrdU staining, they demonstrated that mesenchymal Fgf10 regulates the epithelial expression of Shh, which in turn signals back to the mesenchyme. This was confirmed by the finding that cell proliferation was decreased not only in the palatal epithelium but also in the mesenchyme of Fgfr2b -/- mice. Rice et al. (2004) concluded that coordinated epithelial-mesenchymal interactions are essential during the initial stages of palate development and require an FGF-SHH signaling network. Mice deficient for fibroblast growth factor receptors show abnormalities in early gastrulation and implantation, disruptions in epithelial-mesenchymal interactions, and profound defects in membranous and endochondral bone formation. Activating FGFR mutations are the underlying cause of several craniosynostoses and dwarfism syndromes in humans. Hajihosseini et al. (2001) showed that heterozygotic abrogation of exon 9 of the Fgfr2 gene in mice caused a splicing switch resulting in a gain-of-function mutation. The consequences were neonatal growth retardation and death, coronal synostosis, ocular proptosis, precocious sternal fusion, and abnormalities in secondary branching in several organs that undergo branching morphogenesis. The phenotype was considered to have strong parallels to some Apert (101200) and Pfeiffer (101600) syndrome patients. Eswarakumar et al. (2004) created transgenic mice expressing a gain-of-function mutation (C342T; 176943.0001) in the Fgfr2 gene. Heterozygous mutant mice were viable and fertile with shortened face, protruding eyes, premature fusion of cranial sutures, and enhanced Spp1 (166490) expression in the calvaria. Homozygous mutants displayed multiple joint fusions, cleft palate, and trachea and lung defects, and died shortly after birth. They showed enhanced Cbfa1 expression without significant change in chondrocyte-specific gene expression. Histomorphometric analysis and bone marrow stromal cell culture showed a significant increase of osteoblast progenitors with no change in osteoclastogenic cells. Chondrocyte proliferation was decreased in the skull base at embryonic day 14.5 but not later. Eswarakumar et al. (2004) concluded that the mutant phenotype, including craniosynostosis, is related to FGFR2c regulation of the osteoblast lineage. The effect on early chondrocyte proliferation but not gene expression suggests cooperation of FGFR2c with FGFR3 (134934) in the formation of the cartilage model for endochondral bone.

comment: Small cell cancer of the lung accounts for about a fourth of the 110,000 new cases of lung cancer that occur annually in the United States. It is clinically distinctive: usually metastases are already present at the time of discovery so that surgery is not used. In contrast to adeno- and squamous carcinoma, SCCL is sensitive to chemotherapy and radiotherapy. Whang-Peng et al. (1982) found a specific, acquired chromosomal abnormality (deletion 3p) in at least one chromosome 3 in all metaphases in all 12 cell lines cultured from human SCCL tissue in 2-day tumor culture specimens from 3 patients. The shortest region of overlap showed the deletion to involve 3p23-p14. No other type of lung cancer showed this deletion, nor did lymphoblastoid lines cultured from SCCL patients whose tumors had the 3p deletion. SCCL is 'caused' by cigarette smoking as are other types of lung cancer. Thus, like chronic myeloid leukemia, this is an example of an exogenously induced malignancy with a specific chromosomal change. Cytogenetic effects of cigarette smoke are relevant in this connection (Madle et al., 1981). Several biochemical markers were found to be associated with small cell cancer of the lung (Gazdar et al., 1981; Tapia et al., 1981). Perhaps genes in the 3p14-23 region have something to do with these markers as well as with the genesis of SCCL. (The cell of origin of SCCL is thought to be the Kulchitsky cell, an argentaffine cell situated in the bronchial epithelium, although this is not proved.) Erisman et al. (1982) showed that SCCL contains bombesin, a tetradecapeptide from anuran skin. It had been identified in human fetal and neonatal lung but not in adult lung. Some symptoms of SCCL may be attributable to bombesin. The syndrome of inappropriate secretion of antidiuretic hormone and Cushing syndrome, occurring with SCCL, are due to ectopic production of antidiuretic hormone and ACTH, respectively. The relation between ectopic hormone production and the aberration involving chromosome 3 is unknown. Baylin et al. (1982) found 12 distinguishing surface proteins on SCCL that were not shared by any of the 3 other carcinogen-induced forms of lung cancer (squamous, adeno-, and large cell undifferentiated carcinoma) or by human lymphoblastoid cells and fibroblasts. The neuroendocrine nature of SCCL was supported by the fact that 6 of the 12 were shared by human neuroblastoma cells. On human SCCL cells and tumors, Ruff and Pert (1984) demonstrated 4 surface antigens previously recognized only in macrophages. They suggested that cancerous cells may arise from macrophage precursors in bone marrow, and these precursors migrate to lung to participate in the repair of tissue damage produced by continuous heavy smoking. About 5% of SCCL patients have no apparent pulmonary involvement and the early, rapid and widespread dissemination of tumor to extrathoracic sites requires explanation. Naylor et al. (1984) used an anonymous, polymorphic DNA probe, D3S3, to confirm the presence of deletion of 3p in SCCL. This probe had been assigned to 3p21-cen. Studying 7 SCCL tumors and normal tissue from the same persons, they found that 6 of the 'normal' DNA samples were heterozygous for the D3S3 MspI polymorphism, whereas in all cases the tumor tissues were homozygous. De Leij et al. (1985) isolated 3 new, well-growing cell lines from SCCL. Deletions in 3p, with 3p23-p21 as the smallest region of overlap, were found. Mooibroek et al. (1987) used a recombinant DNA fragment detecting a RFLP presumably at 3p21 to probe DNA isolated from leukocytes of 12 patients with small cell lung cancer. Four of these patients were heterozygous. Analysis of tumor material from the 4 patients showed homozygosity for either one or the other restriction fragment in every case. Gerber and Scoggin (1987) and Naylor et al. (1987) demonstrated loss of constitutional heterozygosity in SCCL. Comparing tumor and constitutional genotypes of 9 patients with small cell lung cancer, Naylor et al. (1987) found a loss of alleles of chromosome 3p markers in tumor DNA of all 9 patients. Brauch et al. (1987) concluded that loss of alleles on 3p is a consistent change in small cell lung cancer but occasionally occurs in non-small cell lung cancer as well. Using a molecular genetic approach, Kok et al. (1987) found evidence for a consistent deletion at the 3p21 region not only in SCCL but in all major types of lung cancer. Yokota et al. (1987) found loss of heterozygosity for RFLPs on chromosome 3p in 7 of 7 patients, on 13q in 10 of 11 patients, and on 17p in 5 of 5 patients. Deletions at these loci in small cell carcinomas were observed even in tumors without any clinical evidence of metastasis. Furthermore, loss of heterozygosity on 3p and 13q occurred before NMYC amplification and before chromosome 11p deletion. (Loss of heterozygosity on 3p was also detected in the adenocarcinomas from 5 of 6 patients. Heterozygosity of chromosomes 13q and 17p was lost in 10 of 31 patients and in 3 of 12 patients, respectively, of lung cancers other than small cell carcinomas.) Johnson et al. (1988) found unequivocal loss of heterozygosity in the DNA from tumor tissue of 23 of 25 patients who were constitutionally heterozygous for at least 1 marker in the region 3p14-p21. Birrer and Minna (1988) pointed to at least 3 molecular mechanisms involved in the development of lung cancer: deletion of 3p, deregulated expression of the MYC family of genes, and growth factors such as gastrin-releasing hormone (137260). Drabkin et al. (1988) demonstrated that the SCLC 'locus' is proximal to ERBA2 (190160) and also to the constitutive 3p14.2 fragile site. Using 15 chromosome 3 probes that identified 19 different RFLPs, Daly et al. (1991) identified a single 3p deletion extending proximal to the D3S2 locus at 3p21-p14.2 and including at least 3p14-p13. The locus D3F15S2 was excluded from the deleted region, an uncharacteristic feature of SCLC deletions. Moreover, D3S30 and D3S4 were included within this deletion, and thus map within the proximal half of chromosome 3p. Leduc et al. (1989) found that virtually all cases of SCLC had lost heterozygosity at the ERBA2 locus. A smaller but substantial portion of non-small cell carcinomas of the lung had lost heterozygosity at this locus. Among all of the non-small cell tumors, some had lost heterozygosity at a proximal locus but not at ERBA2, whereas none were found where the reverse was true. Thus, the locus that plays a role in non-small cell tumorigenesis probably lies proximal to ERBA2 and is almost certainly not the ERBA2 gene. Sellers et al. (1989) presented epidemiologic data supporting the role of mendelian factors in the susceptibility to human lung cancer. The specific pathology of the tumors studied was not stated in the report. From studies of allele loss by use of 13 RFLP probes on 3p, Hibi et al. (1992) concluded that 3 distinct regions on 3p are frequently deleted in lung cancer: 3p25, 3p21.3, and 3p14-cen. Killary et al. (1992) described a rapid genetic assay system that allowed functional analysis of defined areas of 3p in the suppression of tumorigenicity in vivo. Human/mouse microcell hybrids containing fragments of chromosome 3p were constructed and screened for tumorigenicity in athymic nude mice. Hybrid clones were obtained that showed a dramatic tumor suppression and contained a 2-megabase fragment of human chromosomal material encompassing the region 3p21 near the interface with 3p22. This should be the first step toward isolating the tumor suppressor gene. Chen et al. (1996) analyzed microsatellite repeat markers in plasma, tumor samples, and normal cells from 21 patients with a confirmed diagnosis of small cell lung carcinoma (SCLC). They reported that microsatellite alteration (including loss of heterozygosity or the appearance of new size forms) occurred in 16 out of 21 SCLC tumors and in 15 out of 21 plasma samples. In 52% of cases the marker UT762 on chromosome 21 was altered, and in 38% of cases the marker AR (313700) on the X chromosome was altered. Chen et al. (1996) concluded that analysis of plasma DNA may constitute a new tool for tumor staging, management, or possibly detection. See also 275355. Watkins et al. (2003) investigated a role for the sonic hedgehog (SHH; 600725) pathway in regeneration and carcinogenesis of airway epithelium. They demonstrated extensive activation of the hedgehog pathway within the airway epithelium during repair of acute airway injury. This mode of hedgehog signaling is characterized by the elaboration and reception of the SHH signal within the epithelial compartment, and immediately precedes neuroendocrine differentiation. A similar pattern of hedgehog signaling in airway development during normal differentiation of pulmonary neuroendocrine precursor cells, and in a subset of small cell lung cancer, was also observed. Small cell lung cancer tumors maintain their malignant phenotype in vitro and in vivo through ligand-dependent hedgehog pathway activation. Watkins et al. (2003) proposed that some types of small cell lung cancer might recapitulate a critical hedgehog-regulated event in airway epithelial differentiation. This requirement for hedgehog pathway activation identified a common lethal malignancy that may respond to pharmacologic blockade of the hedgehog signaling pathway.

comment: See SOX1 602148 for discussion of this family of genes. CLONING Stevanovic et al. (1994) found that the SOX2 gene encodes a 317-amino acid protein. GENE FUNCTION In developing chick spinal cord, Bylund et al. (2003) found that Sox1 (602148), Sox2, and Sox3 (313340) were coexpressed in self-renewing progenitor cells and acted to inhibit neuronal differentiation. Active repression of the Sox genes promoted neural progenitor cells to initiate differentiation prematurely. Further studies showed that the ability of the proneural transcription factor neurogenin-2 (NEUROG2; 606624) to promote neuronal differentiation was based on its ability to suppress Sox gene expression, thus showing that neurogenesis is regulated by an interplay between proneural proteins and inhibitory proteins. GENE STRUCTURE Genetic analysis by Fantes et al. (2003) indicated that the single-exon SOX2 gene lies in an intron of the SOX2OT (SOX2 overlapping transcript) gene. - SOX2OT Gene Fantes et al. (2003) determined that SOX2OT is a noncoding gene with no open reading frame encoding a peptide of more than 70 amino acids. It has at least 5 exons and produces a 3.4-kb mRNA from the same strand as SOX2, and human SOX2OT shares 88% identity with mouse Sox2ot. The 40-kb genomic region encompassing SOX2OT is highly conserved. Noncoding RNAs often have complex regulatory roles in the cell, suggesting that SOX2OT may be involved in transcriptional regulation of SOX2. MAPPING By fluorescence in situ hybridization, Stevanovic et al. (1994) assigned the SOX2 gene to 3q26.3-q27. MOLECULAR GENETICS Smith et al. (1999) excluded the SOX2 gene as a candidate for Cornelia de Lange syndrome (122470). Bilateral anophthalmia (206900) is the rarest and most severe form of structural eye malformation. Chitayat et al. (1996) and Male et al. (2002) identified constitutional deletions involving 3q27 in 3 unrelated individuals with anophthalmia. Driggers et al. (1999) and Kurbasic et al. (2000) reported de novo apparently balanced reciprocal translocations involving 3q27 in 2 patients with severe bilateral microphthalmia and microphthalmia/anophthalmia. In the female infant reported by Driggers et al. (1999) with isolated bilateral anophthalmia and a de novo t(3;11)(q27;p11.2), Fantes et al. (2003) identified a submicroscopic deletion at the 3q breakpoint. This deletion contained SOX2. Subsequent SOX2 mutation analysis identified de novo truncating mutations of SOX2 in 4 of 35 (11%) individuals with anophthalmia (184429.0001-184429.0003). Both eyes were affected in all cases with an identified mutation. In each case the mutation was present in heterozygous state; the parents of each individual with a mutation in SOX2 had normal SOX2 sequence. Ragge et al. (2005) reported 4 patients with bilateral anophthalmia/microphthalmia and de novo heterozygous mutations in SOX2, including a missense mutation (184429.0004) and 3 frameshift mutations. In a 12-year-old girl with bilateral clinical anophthalmia, Hagstrom et al. (2005) identified heterozygosity for a nonsense mutation in the SOX2 gene (184429.0005). ANIMAL MODEL Dong et al. (2002) identified 2 allelic mouse mutants, 'light coat and circling' (Lcc) and 'yellow submarine' (Ysb), that show hearing and balance impairment. Lcc/Lcc mice are completely deaf, whereas Ysb/Ysb mice are severely hearing impaired. Kiernan et al. (2005) reported that inner ears of Lcc/Lcc mice failed to establish a prosensory domain and neither hair cells nor supporting cells differentiated, resulting in a severe inner ear malformation, whereas the sensory epithelium of Ysb/Ysb mice showed abnormal development with disorganized and fewer hair cells. These phenotypes are due to the absence (in Lcc mutants) or reduced expression (in Ysb mutants) of the transcription factor Sox2, specifically within the developing inner ear. Kiernan et al. (2005) showed that Sox2 continues to be expressed in the inner ears of mice lacking Math1 (601461), a gene essential for hair cell differentiation, whereas Math1 expression is absent in Lcc mutants, suggesting that Sox2 acts upstream of Math1.

comment: CLONING The SOX genes (so named for SRY-box) comprise a large family related by homology to the HMG-box region of the testis-determining gene SRY (480000). Four Sox genes were originally isolated from the mouse. These genes are autosomal or X-linked and can be divided into 2 subfamilies: the sequences of mouse Sox-1, -2, and -3 are almost identical in the conserved HMG-box motif, whereas Sox-4 seems to have diverged independently, showing 78% homology to the other 3 genes at the DNA level. Denny et al. (1992) identified several other members of the Sox gene family. Farr et al. (1993) cloned and sequenced the human SOX4 gene. The open reading frame encoded a 474-amino acid protein, which included an HMG-box. The deduced amino acid sequence of the human SOX4 gene is consistent with its being a transcription factor. GENE FUNCTION SOX4 from both human and mouse was shown by van de Wetering et al. (1993) to be expressed primarily in T and pre-B lymphocyte cell lines. They also showed that the mouse Sox4 protein binds with high affinity to the (A/T)(A/T)CAAAG motif found in several T-cell specific enhancers. By transient expression of chimeric Sox4 constructs, van de Wetering et al. (1993) showed that Sox4 has separable DNA-binding and transactivation domains. The authors concluded that SOX4 is a lymphocyte-specific transcriptional activator. Using a yeast 2-hybrid screen, Geijsen et al. (2001) identified the mouse transcriptional factor Sox4 as a binding partner for syntenin (SDCBP; 602217) but not for interleukin-5 receptor-alpha (IL5RA; 147851), which interacts with the PDZ domains of syntenin. The syntenin-Sox4 interaction occurs outside of the PDZ domains of syntenin. Luciferase reporter analysis and fluorescence microscopy showed that IL5 (147850), but not IL3 (147740), induces cytoplasmic and nuclear expression of syntenin and, in a syntenin- and cytoplasmic IL5RA-dependent manner, of Sox4. Geijsen et al. (2001) concluded that syntenin acts as an adaptor molecule in the IL5RA-mediated activation of SOX4. They also noted that mice lacking either Il5ra or Sox4 have defects in B-cell development. Retroviral insertional mutagenesis in the mouse strains BXH2 and AKXD induces a high incidence of myeloid leukemia and B- and T-cell lymphoma, respectively. The retroviral integration sites in these tumors thus provide powerful genetic tags for the discovery of genes involved in cancer (Li et al., 1999; Hansen et al., 2000). Suzuki et al. (2002) reported a large-scale use of retroviral tagging for cancer gene discovery. Using high throughput inverse PCR, they cloned and analyzed the sequences of 884 retroviral integration sites from a tumor panel composed primarily of B-cell lymphomas. They then compared these sequences, and another 415 retroviral integration site sequences previously cloned from BXH2 myeloid leukemias and AKXD lymphomas, against the mouse genome sequence assembled by Celera. Suzuki et al. (2002) identified 152 loci that are targets of retroviral integration in more than 1 tumor (so-called common retroviral integration sites) and therefore likely to encode cancer genes. Thirty-six common retroviral integration sites encoded genes or their homologs that were known or predicted to be involved in human cancer, whereas others encoded candidate genes that had not been examined for a role in human cancer. The studies of Suzuki et al. (2002) demonstrated both the power of retroviral tagging for cancer gene discovery and the largely unrecognized complexity in mouse and presumably human cancer. Sox4 (Evi16), found in 55 tumors, was the most frequently targeted common retroviral integration site; 177 AKXD tumors and 17 NFS.V+ tumors were studied. Lund et al. (2002) used a similar approach of insertional mutagenesis to identify loci that can participate in tumorigenesis in collaboration with loss of the Cdkn2a-encoded tumor suppressors p16ink4a and p19arf (600160). MAPPING By study of somatic cell hybrids, Farr et al. (1993) mapped the SOX4 gene to 6p, distal to the MHC region (6pter-p21.3). Fluorescence in situ hybridization (FISH) placed the gene at 6p23. Critcher et al. (1998) used FISH to refine the localization of the human SOX4 gene to 6p22.3 and to map the mouse homolog to the syntenic region of chromosome 13 (bands A3-A5).

comment: A number sign (#) is used with this entry because of evidence that the DiGeorge syndrome can be caused by mutation in the TBX1 gene (602054). DESCRIPTION DiGeorge syndrome (DGS) comprises hypocalcemia arising from parathyroid hypoplasia, thymic hypoplasia, and outflow tract defects of the heart. Disturbance of cervical neural crest migration into the derivatives of the pharyngeal arches and pouches can account for the phenotype. Most cases result from a deletion of chromosome 22q11.2 (the DiGeorge syndrome chromosome region, or DGCR). Several genes are lost including the putative transcription factor TUPLE1 which is expressed in the appropriate distribution. This deletion may present with a variety of phenotypes: Shprintzen, or velocardiofacial, syndrome (VCFS; 192430); conotruncal anomaly face (or Takao syndrome); and isolated outflow tract defects of the heart including tetralogy of Fallot, truncus arteriosus, and interrupted aortic arch. A collective acronym CATCH22 has been proposed for these differing presentations. A small number of cases of DGS have defects in other chromosomes, notably 10p13. In the mouse, a transgenic Hox A3 (Hox 1.5) knockout produces a phenotype similar to DGS as do the teratogens retinoic acid and alcohol. NOMENCLATURE DiGeorge syndrome overlaps clinically with the disorder described by the Japanese as 'conotruncal anomaly face syndrome' (Kinouchi et al., 1976; Takao et al., 1980; Shimizu et al., 1984), where the cardiovascular presentation is the focus of attention. The term conotruncal anomaly face syndrome is cumbersome and has the disadvantage of using embryologic assumptions as a title. It would be appropriate to use Takao syndrome for those cases with a preponderant cardiac presentation in contrast to the low T cell and hypocalcemic presentation in infancy of DiGeorge syndrome and the craniofacial and palatal abnormalities typical of Shprintzen syndrome. These 3 phenotypes may be seen in the same family and most cases of all 3 categories have been shown to have a 22q11 deletion. This led Wilson et al. (1993) to propose the acronym CATCH22 (Cardiac Abnormality/abnormal facies, T cell deficit due to thymic hypoplasia, Cleft palate, Hypocalcemia due to hypoparathyroidism resulting from 22q11 deletion) as a collective acronym for those with the common genetic etiology. Shprintzen (1994) objected to 'lumping' velocardiofacial syndrome with the DiGeorge anomaly, arguing that there is 'no valid evidence to suggest that velocardiofacial syndrome is etiologically heterogeneous...[whereas] the DiGeorge anomaly is known to be so.' Hall (1993) cited data of Driscoll et al. (1993) indicating that velocardiofacial syndrome is etiologically heterogeneous. She stated that '...68% of Shprintzen syndrome patients...have been recognised to have deletions of 22q11.' Shprintzen (1994) refuted her statement, maintaining that it could accurately be stated that deletion was found in 68% of patients sent to the Driscoll laboratory with a diagnosis of velocardiofacial syndrome made by other clinicians. Shprintzen (1994) said that in his sample, 100% had deletion. Burn (1999), one of the original proposers of the acronym CATCH22, reviewed the discussion of nomenclature. He recognized that the term CATCH22 had a number of negative connotations and that in practice different terms were in use for this phenotype and would continue to be so. Burn (1999) proposed that the term DiGeorge syndrome be reserved for those with neonatal presentation, particularly with thymic hypoplasia and hypocalcemia, and that the designation VCFS be used for children with a presentation dominated by nasal speech due to palatal insufficiency. He also suggested that 'conotruncal anomaly face' be replaced by 'Takao syndrome' and pointed out that the term '22q11 deletion syndrome' was reasonable. Finally, Burn (1999) proposed that 'CATCH phenotype' be used rather than CATCH22 and that the acronym be taken to represent cardiac abnormality, T cell deficit, clefting, and hypocalcemia. CLINICAL FEATURES DiGeorge syndrome is characterized by neonatal hypocalcemia, which may present as tetany or seizures, due to hypoplasia of the parathyroid glands, and susceptibility to infection due to a deficit of T cells. The immune deficit is caused by hypoplasia or aplasia of the thymus gland. A variety of cardiac malformations are seen in particular affecting the outflow tract. These include tetralogy of Fallot, type B interrupted aortic arch, truncus arteriosus, right aortic arch and aberrant right subclavian artery. In infancy, micrognathia may be present. The ears are typically low set and deficient in the vertical diameter with abnormal folding of the pinna. Telecanthus with short palpebral fissures is seen. Both upward and downward slanting eyes have been described. The philtrum is short and the mouth relatively small. In the older child the features overlap Shprintzen syndrome (velocardiofacial syndrome) with a rather bulbous nose and square nasal tip and hypernasal speech associated with submucous or overt palatal clefting. Cases presenting later tend to have a milder spectrum of cardiac defect with ventricular septal defect being common. Short stature and variable mild to moderate learning difficulties are common. A variety of psychiatric disorders have been described in a small proportion of adult cases of velocardiofacial syndrome. These have included paranoid schizophrenia and major depressive illness. Clinical features seen more rarely include hypothyroidism, cleft lip, and deafness. Goodship et al. (1995) described monozygotic twin brothers with precisely the same 22q11.2 deletion but somewhat discordant clinical phenotype. Both twins had a small mouth, square nasal tip, short palpebral fissures, and small ears with deficient upper helices. Twin 1 had bilateral hair whorls and twin 2 had a right-sided hair whorl. Toes 4 and 5 were curled under bilaterally in both boys, this being more marked in twin 1. The twins were said to have had a single placenta although the findings of a detailed examination were not recorded. Twin 1 weighed 2,200 g and twin 2 weighed 2,800 g. Twin 1 had tetralogy of Fallot, which was repaired at 1 year of age. Twin 2 had a normal cardiovascular system. Twin 1 started taking steps at 24 months of age, while his brother stood at 13 months and walked steadily at 18 months. These observations indicated to Goodship et al. (1995) that differences in deletion size and modifying genetic loci are not responsible for all the phenotypic differences observed in CATCH 22. Vincent et al. (1999) reported the case of female monozygotic twins with 22qll deletions. The twins shared facial characteristics of DGS/VCFS and immunologic defect. However, only one, who died on day 5, had a cardiac defect, comprised of an interrupted aortic arch with a ventricular septal defect, a truncus arteriosus, and a large arterial duct. The authors stated that this was the fourth report of a discrepant cardiac status between monozygotic twins harboring 22q11 deletions. Wilson et al. (1992) looked for deletions in 9 families with 2 or more cases of outflow tract heart defects. In 5 of the families, chromosome 22 deletions were detected in all living affected persons studied and also in the clinically normal father of 3 affected children. The deletion was transmitted from parents to offspring and was associated with an increase in the severity of cardiac defects. No deletions were found in 4 families in which the parents were normal and affected sibs had anatomically identical defects, presumably an autosomal recessive form of congenital heart defect. Fokstuen et al. (1998) analyzed 110 patients with nonselective syndromic or isolated nonfamilial congenital heart malformations by fluorescence in situ hybridization using the D22S75 DGS region probe. A 22q11.2 microdeletion was detected in 9 of 51 (17.6%) syndromic patients. Five were of maternal origin and 4 of paternal origin. None of the 59 patients with isolated congenital cardiac defect had the 22q11.2 deletion. In a study of 157 consecutively catheterized patients with isolated, nonsyndromic cardiac defects, and 25 patients with cardiac malformation and additional abnormalities (10 of whom had been clinically diagnosed as DiGeorge syndrome or velocardiofacial syndrome), Borgmann et al. (1999) found the 22q11.2 microdeletion only in the latter group. Jawad et al. (2001) studied 195 patients with chromosome 22q11 deletion syndrome and found that diminished T-cell counts in the peripheral blood are common. The pattern of changes seen with ageing in normal control patients was also seen in patients with the chromosome 22q11.2 deletion syndrome, although the decline in T cells was blunted. Autoimmune disease was seen in most age groups, although the types of disorders varied according to age. Infections were also common in older patients, although they were seldom life-threatening. Juvenile rheumatoid arthritis with onset between 1.5 and 6 years of age was seen in 4 of the 195 patients; idiopathic thrombocytopenia purpura with onset at 1 to 8 years of age was seen in 8 of 195 patients; autoimmune hemolytic anemia, psoriasis, vitiligo, inflammatory bowel disease, adult rheumatoid arthritis, and rheumatic fever with chorea were each seen in 1 patient of the 195 patients sampled. Kawame et al. (2001) reported 5 patients with chromosome 22q11.2 deletion that manifested Graves disease between the ages of 27 months and 16 years, and suggested that Graves disease may be part of the clinical spectrum of this disorder. Bassett et al. (2005) described the phenotypic features of 78 adults with 22q11 deletion syndrome and identified 43 distinct features present in more than 5% of patients. Common characteristic features included intellectual disabilities (92.3%), hypocalcemia (64%), palatal anomalies (42%), and cardiovascular anomalies (25.8%). Other less commonly appreciated features included obesity (35%), hypothyroidism (20.5%), hearing deficits (28%), cholelithiasis (19%), scoliosis (47%), and dermatologic abnormalities (severe acne, 23%; seborrhea, 35%). Significantly, schizophrenia was present in 22.6% of patients. Maalouf et al. (2004) reported an African-American male diagnosed at age 32 years with dysgenesis of the parathyroid glands due to a chromosome 22 microdeletion. Symptomatic hypocalcemia did not develop until age 14 years, a few weeks after initiation of anticonvulsant therapy for generalized tonic-clonic seizures. Because of the timing for onset of symptomatic hypocalcemia, it was presumed that the patient had anticonvulsant-induced hypocalcemia, and he carried that diagnosis for 18 years. Chromosome 22q11 deletion syndrome was first suspected at age 32 years. The diagnosis was confirmed by fluorescence in situ hybridization analysis. This case underscores the variable clinical presentation of this congenital form of hypoparathyroidism. BIOCHEMICAL FEATURES Hypocalcemia secondary to hypoparathyroidism is the key biochemical feature and may be sufficiently severe to be symptomatic. Resolution in early childhood is typical, although the deficient function of the parathyroids may be exposed in adulthood by infusion of disodium edetate (EDTA) (Gidding et al., 1988). The patient of Gidding et al. (1988) had isolated conotruncal cardiac defect and, despite normal baseline ionized calcium and midmolecule parathyroid hormone levels, she failed to increase the secretion of midmolecular parathyroid hormone appropriately in response to a hypocalcemic challenge. They speculated that this combination of latent-hypoparathyroidism (LHP) and conotruncal cardiac defects should be included in the clinical spectrum of DiGeorge anomaly. Indeed, this woman's fourth child died with DiGeorge anomaly. Seven years after the report by Gidding et al. (1988), Cuneo et al. (1997) restudied the index patient with LHP and evaluated 3 generations of her family for parathyroid dysfunction, cardiac anomalies, and del22q11. Deletions were found in 6 relatives, 3 with conotruncal cardiac defects and 3 with a structurally normal heart. They found significant transgenerational noncardiac phenotypic variability, including learning difficulties, dysmorphic facial appearance, and psychiatric illness. A spectrum of parathyroid gland dysfunction associated with the del22(q11) was seen, ranging from hypocalcemic hypoparathyroidism to normocalcemia with abnormally low basal intact parathyroid hormone levels. In addition, LPH found in the index patient 7 years previously had evolved to frank hypocalcemic hypoparathyroidism. Kousseff (1984) described 3 sibs with a syndrome of sacral meningocele, conotruncal cardiac defects, unilateral renal agenesis (in 1 sib), low-set and posteriorly angulated ears, retrognathia, and short neck with low posterior hairline. Kousseff (1984) suggested autosomal recessive inheritance. Toriello et al. (1985) reported a similar, isolated case and designated the disorder Kousseff syndrome. Forrester et al. (2002) restudied the family reported by Kousseff (1984) and identified a 22q11-q13 deletion in the proband, his deceased brother, and his father. The proband had spina bifida, shunted hydrocephalus, cleft palate, short stature, cognitive impairment, and the typical craniofacial features of velocardiofacial syndrome, including low-set and dysplastic ears, broad base of the nose, narrow alae nasi, and retrognathia. His brother had died at 2 weeks of age with myelomeningocele, hydrocephalus, transposition of the great vessels, and unilateral renal agenesis, and his sister had died at 22 days of age with myelomeningocele, truncus arteriosus, hypocalcemia, and autopsy findings of absent thymus and parathyroid glands, consistent with DiGeorge anomaly. OTHER FEATURES The deficit in thymic function results in a lack of T cells which may be demonstrated by measuring the proportion of CD4 cells (Wilson et al., 1993). Immunohistochemical analysis of the parathyroids reveals a deficit of thyrocalcitonin immunoreactive cells (C cells) (Palacios et al., 1993). Levy et al. (1997) stated that 10 to 25% of parents of patients with DGS exhibit the 22q11 deletion but are nearly asymptomatic. The authors described 2 female patients carrying a 22q11 microdeletion who presented with idiopathic thrombocytopenic purpura. Both had children with typical manifestations of DGS. The possibility that defective thymic function predisposes patients with DGS to autoimmune diseases was raised. INHERITANCE DiGeorge syndrome is usually sporadic and results from de novo 22 deletion. A long series of reports has recognized the variable features resulting from this deletion in multiple family members with the variable phenotype behaving as an autosomal dominant trait (Steele et al., 1972; Raatikka et al., 1981; Atkin et al., 1982; Rohn et al., 1984; Keppen et al., 1988; Stevens et al., 1990). Stevens et al. (1990) suggested that such familial cases should be regarded as being velocardiofacial syndrome. The variable phenotype was described by Strong (1968) prior to the recognition of DGS. The mother in that family developed a psychotic illness. The first dominant pedigree in which marked clinical variability was associated with dominant transmission of a 22q11 deletion was reported by Wilson et al. (1991); the mother had the typical dysmorphic features. Of the 3 affected offspring, one had coarctation of the aorta, one a ventricular septal defect, and one DGS. Wilson et al. (1991) found 5 of 9 families ascertained on the basis of familial outflow tract defects to have 22q11 deletion. Subtle dysmorphic features typical of those seen in DGS were apparent in several of these affected family members. CYTOGENETICS De la Chapelle et al. (1981) suggested that DiGeorge syndrome may be due to a deletion within chromosome 22 or partial duplication of 20p, based on finding the syndrome in members of a family with a 20;22 translocation. Specifically, they observed DGS in 4 members of 1 family and demonstrated monosomy of 22pter-q11 and 20p duplication. Their interpretation that DGS might result from monosomy for 22q11 was confirmed by Kelley et al. (1982) in 3 patients with translocation of 22q11-qter to other chromosomes. Greenberg et al. (1984) observed partial monosomy due to an unbalanced 4;22 translocation in a 2-month-old male with type 1 truncus arteriosus and features of DGS. The asymptomatic mother showed partial T-cell deficiency and the same unbalanced translocation with deletion of proximal 22q11. Augusseau et al. (1986) observed telecanthus, microretrognathia, severe aortic coarctation with hypoplastic left aortic arch, decreased E rosettes, and mild neonatal hypocalcemia. The same translocation was present in the clinically normal mother and maternal aunt. The latter had had her fourth pregnancy aborted because of cardiac and other malformations detected on ultrasound. This translocation has proved important in analysis of the expressed sequences in the deleted segment. The recognition of the importance of 22q11 deletion grew with improving techniques. Greenberg et al. (1988) found chromosome abnormalities in 5 of 27 cases of DGS, 3 with 22q11 deletion though only one of these was an interstitial deletion. Wilson et al. (1992) reported high resolution banding (more than 850 bands per haploid set) in 30 of 36 cases of DGS and demonstrated 9 cases of interstitial deletion. All other cases were apparently normal. Use of molecular dosage analysis and fluorescence in situ hybridization with probes isolated from within the deleted area revealed deletion in 21 of the 22 cases with normal karyotypes (Carey et al., 1992) giving pooled results of 33 deleted among the consecutive series of 35 cases. Driscoll et al. (1992) also found deletions at the molecular level in all 14 cases studied. Whereas 90% of cases of DGS may now be attributed to a 22q11 deletion, other chromosome defects have been identified. In the report of Greenberg et al. (1988), there was 1 case of DGS with del10p13 and one with an 18q21.33 deletion. Fukushima et al. (1992) found a female infant with a deletion of 4q21.3-q25 associated with interrupted aortic arch, VSD, ASD, and PDA; T cell deficit and a small thymus at surgery; absent corpus callosum; and dysmorphic features. The possibility of an unrecognized submicroscopic deletion of 22q11 should be considered in such cases, although it is clear that the disturbance of neural crest migration presumed to underlie DGS may be caused by several distinct defects at the molecular level. Pinto-Escalante et al. (1998) described a premature male infant with mosaic monosomy of chromosome 22. His facial appearance was similar to that in DiGeorge syndrome; hypertonicity, limitation of extension of major joints, and flexion contracture of all fingers were also present. They found previous reports of monosomy 22 in 6 cases, 3 of which were nonmosaic and 3 mosaic. There was great variability in anomalies in these patients; however, the most common anomalies were in the face and joints. Gottlieb et al. (1998) determined the location and extent of the deletion on chromosome 10 in 5 DiGeorge syndrome patients by means of a combination of heterozygosity tests and fluorescence in situ hybridization analysis. The results did not support the existence of a single, commonly deleted region on 10p in these 5 patients. Rather, they suggested that deletion of more than 1 region on 10p could be associated with the DGS phenotype. Furthermore, there was no obvious correlation between the phenotypic traits of the patients and the extent of the deletion. The patient with the largest deletion exhibited one of the less severe phenotypes. The authors commented that the lack of a correlation between the size of a deletion and the phenotype is observed also with deletions on chromosome 22 and may be a characteristic of haploinsufficiency disorders. MAPPING A large series of polymorphic markers and some expressed sequences have now been identified in the critical region (Fibison and Emanuel, 1987; Fibison et al., 1990; Scambler et al., 1990). The deletion lies proximal to the breakpoint critical region (151410). Details of the mapping of DGS to 22q11 are located in the Molecular Genetics and Cytogenetics sections of this entry. Galili et al. (1997) documented homology of synteny between a 150-kb region on mouse chromosome 16 and the portion of 22q11.2 most commonly deleted in DiGeorge syndrome and VCFS. They identified 7 genes, all of which are transcribed in the early mouse embryo. In 2 children with a DiGeorge syndrome phenotype from a consanguineous family, in whom deletion analysis at 22q11.2 and 10p14-p13 did not reveal any abnormality, Henwood et al. (2001) carried out microsatellite analysis. The affected children were homozygous at 3 markers within the 22q11.2 region, the markers being those at NLJH1, D22S941, and D22S944. The unaffected sib and the unaffected parents were heterozygous at these markers. A subsequent child who appeared to be unaffected was also found to be homozygous for the markers at these loci. Henwood et al. (2001), however, pointed out that nonpenetrance might be possible. MOLECULAR GENETICS Several expressed sequences have been identified in the region commonly deleted. Aubry et al. (1993) have identified a zinc finger gene ZNF74, Halford et al. (1993) reported the expressed sequence T10. The gene TUPLE1 (TUP-like enhancer of split gene-1; 600237) reported by Halford et al. (1993) is an attractive candidate for the central features of the syndrome. This putative transcription factor shows homology to the yeast transcription factor TUP, and to Drosophila enhancer of split. It contains 4 WD40 domains and shows evidence of expression at the critical period of development in the outflow tract of the heart and the neural crest derived aspects of the face and upper thorax. The gene localizes to the critical DiGeorge region but was not disrupted by the translocation breakpoint described by Augusseau et al. (1986). The possibility of this being a contiguous gene syndrome remains. Augusseau et al. (1986) described a patient (ADU) with 'partial' DGS. She had telecanthus, microretrognathia, severe aortic coarctation with hypoplastic left aortic arch, decreased E rosettes, and mild neonatal hypocalcemia. The apparently balanced translocation involved chromosomes 2 and 22: t(2;22)(q14;q11). The same translocation was present in her mother (VDU). The original paper reported that VDU had no features of DGS. However, Budarf et al. (1995) observed that subsequent publications cited VDU as mildly affected with hypernasal speech, micrognathia, and inverted T4/T8 ratio, which are all features seen in VCFS and DGS. The DGS phenotype in ADU, the VCFS phenotype in VDU, and a balanced translocation of chromosome 22 in both led Budarf et al. (1995) to clone the translocation, sequence the region containing the breakpoint, and analyze the DNA sequence for transcript identification. A gene disrupted by the rearrangement was identified. Their analysis suggested that there are at least 2 transcripts on opposite strands in the region of the t(2;22) breakpoint. The breakpoint disrupted a predicted ORF of one of these genes, deleting 11 nucleotides at the translocation junction. Additional fluorescence in situ hybridization studies and Southern blot analysis demonstrated that the deletions in chromosome 22 deletion-positive patients with DGS/VCFS include both of the transcripts at the t(2;22) breakpoint. Support that either of these putative genes is of significance in the etiology of DGS might come from determining whether all deleted patients are hemizygous for these loci and whether mutations in these genes are detectable in nondeletion patients with features of DGS. Lacking such evidence, the possibility remains that the translocation separates a locus control region from its target gene or produces a position effect. This has been suggested for the role of translocations seen in association with autosomal sex reversal and campomelic dysplasia (CMD1; 114290), where several disease-causing translocation breakpoints map 50 kb or more 5-prime of the SOX9 gene (608160). Bartsch et al. (2003) used cytogenetic and analyses to study a series of 295 patients with suspected DiGeorge/velocardiofacial syndrome. They identified 58 subjects with a 22q11 deletion, and none with a 10p deletion. The common deletion was present in 52 subjects, the proximal deletion in 5, and an atypical proximal deletion due to a 1;22 translocation in 1. Bartsch et al. (2003) suggested that intellectual and/or behavioral outcome may be better with the proximal versus the common 22q11 deletion. Demczuk et al. (1995) pointed to the existence of a strong tendency for 22q11.2 deletions in DGS, VCFS, and isolated conotruncal cardiac disease to be of maternal origin. With their experience of 22 cases in which parental origin could be determined, combined with recent results from the literature, 24 cases were found to be of maternal origin and 8 of paternal origin, yielding a probability of less than 0.01. Demczuk et al. (1995) reported the isolation and cloning of a gene encoding a potential adhesion receptor protein (600594) in the DGCR. They designated the gene DGCR2 and suggested DGCR1 as a symbol for the TUPLE1 gene. Pizzuti et al. (1996) described the cloning and tissue expression of a human homolog of the Drosophila 'dishevelled' gene (601225), a gene required for the establishment of fly embryonic segments. The 3-prime untranslated region of the gene was positioned within the DGS critical region and was found to be deleted in DGS patients. The authors stated that the gene may be involved in the pathogenesis of DGS. Demczuk et al. (1996) described the cloning of a gene, which they referred to as DGCR6 (601279), from the DGS critical region. The putative protein encoded by this gene shows homology with Drosophila melanogaster gonadal protein (gdl) and with the gamma-1 chain of human laminin (150290), which maps to chromosome 1q31. Edelmann et al. (1999) developed hamster-human somatic hybrid cell lines from VCFS/DGS patients and showed by use of haplotype analysis with a set of 16 ordered genetic markers on 22q11 that the breakpoints occurred within similar low copy repeats, designated LCR22s. Models were presented to explain how the LCR22s can mediate different homologous recombination events, thereby generating a number of rearrangements that are associated with congenital anomaly disorders. Shaikh et al. (2000) completed sequencing of the 3-Mb typically deleted region (TDR) and identified 4 LCRs within it. Although the LCRs differed in content and organization of shared modules, those modules that were common between them shared 97 to 98% sequence identity with one another. Sequence analysis of rearranged junction fragments from variant deletions in 3 DGS/VCFS patients implicated the LCRs directly in the formation of 22q11.2 deletions. FISH analysis of nonhuman primates suggested that the duplication events which generated the nest of LCRs may have occurred at least 20 to 25 million years ago. Stalmans et al. (2003) reported that absence of the 164-amino acid isoform of Vegf (Vegf164; see 192240), the only one that binds neuropilin-1 (602069), causes birth defects in mice reminiscent of those found in patients with deletion of 22q11. The close correlation of birth and vascular defects indicated that vascular dysgenesis may pathogenetically contribute to the birth defects. Vegf interacted with Tbx1, as Tbx1 expression was reduced in Vegf164-deficient embryos and knocked-down Vegf levels enhanced the pharyngeal arch artery defects induced by Tbx1 knockdown in zebrafish. Moreover, initial evidence suggested that a Vegf promoter haplotype was associated with an increased risk for cardiovascular birth defects in del22q11 individuals. Stalmans et al. (2003) concluded that genetic data in mouse, fish, and human indicated that VEGF is a modifier of cardiovascular birth defects in the del22q11 syndrome. Baldini (2002) reviewed the molecular basis of DiGeorge syndrome, with special emphasis on mouse models and the role of TBX1 in development of the pharyngeal arches. Yagi et al. (2003) screened for mutations in the coding sequence of TBX1 in 13 patients from 10 families who had the 22q11.2 syndrome phenotype but no detectable deletion in 22q11.2. They identified 3 mutations in TBX1 in 2 unrelated patients: 1 mutation was found in a case of sporadic conotruncal anomaly face syndrome/velocardiofacial syndrome and a second in a sporadic case of DiGeorge syndrome (602054.0002). A third mutation was found in 3 patients from a family with conotruncal anomaly face syndrome/velocardiofacial syndrome. The findings of Yagi et al. (2003) indicated that TBX1 mutations are responsible for 5 major phenotypes of the 22q11.2 syndrome, namely, abnormal facies (conotruncal anomaly face), cardiac defects, thymic hypoplasia, velopharyngeal insufficiency of the cleft palate, and parathyroid dysfunction with hypocalcemia; these mutations did not appear to be responsible for typical mental retardation that is commonly seen in patients with the deletion form of 22q11.2 syndrome. Fernandez et al. (2005) found that 7 (13%) of 55 index patients with 22q11.2 deletion syndrome diagnosed by FISH analysis had inherited the deletion; 2 of the index patients were related as half sibs and had received the deletion from their shared mother. Using molecular techniques to characterize the size of the deletion, The authors found that 3 of 5 families had the smaller 1.5- to 2-Mb deletion and 2 families had the larger 3-Mb deletion; the size of the deletion in 1 family could not be determined. The findings suggested that small deletions may be more common in familial inheritance than larger deletions. Although the clinical severity did not differ between the 2 groups of patients, Fernandez et al. (2005) postulated that the smaller deletion may be associated with higher fecundity than the larger deletion. HETEROGENEITY The association of the DiGeorge syndrome with at least 2 and possibly more chromosomal locations suggests strongly that several genes are involved in control of migration of neural crest cells and their subsequent fixation and differentiation at different sites. In the mouse, Chisaka and Capecchi (1991) described a knockout of Hox A3(1.5) which produced a recessive phenocopy of DGS. This gene maps to human chromosome 7, an area not yet implicated in the cause of the human syndrome. One explanation for the wide variation in phenotype would be the need for more than 1 gene defect to produce the severe version. Thus, for example, impaired signal and receptor may be needed to produce the full phenotype. Environmental factors could also play an additive role. Features of DGS have been described in children with clinical evidence of fetal alcohol syndrome. Ammann et al. (1982) found 4 children among a referral population with immunodeficiency who had hypocalcemia with decreased levels of parathormone, and T cell rosette formation of between 9 and 50% (normal over 65%). All 4 had cardiovascular lesions compatible with DGS; VSD with right aortic arch, truncus arteriosus and pulmonary stenosis, aberrant subclavian artery and pulmonary valve stenosis respectively. Two of the children had absent thymus at direct examination. The alcohol may have directly disrupted neural crest migration or have exposed a genetic predisposition. Among a series of pregnancies exposed to the teratogen isotretinoin (vitamin A) reported by Lammer et al. (1985) 21 malformed infants were investigated; 8 had conotruncal defects or aortic arch anomalies, 6 had micrognathia, 3 had cleft palate and 7 had thymic defects. Several of these children would satisfy the diagnostic criteria of DGS. Again, it is likely that this environmental challenge is exposing the same susceptible pathways of development as are impaired by the 22q11 deletion though the possibility of an interaction between the insult and genotype remains open. DIAGNOSIS The dysmorphic facial appearance in an individual with a major outflow tract defect of the heart or a history of recurrent infection should raise suspicion. In infancy, hypocalcemia is a characteristic feature although this may be intermittent and has a tendency to resolve during the first year. Immunological assessment relies on chest radiography to detect a thymic shadow, a notoriously unreliable investigation, particularly in the stressed infant, and measurement of the CD4-positive subset of white cells. With the rapid progress in molecular cytogenetics, the investigation of choice is now a standard karyotype to exclude major rearrangements and fluorescence in situ hybridization using probes from within the deletion segment, preferably those close to the translocation breakpoint site. Where cell suspension or fresh blood cannot be obtained for karyotype, allele loss may be sought with a series of the hypervariable probes in the region. Parents should be screened for carrier status. CLINICAL MANAGEMENT Calcium supplements and 1,25-cholecalciferol may be needed to treat hypocalcemia. Thymic transplantation has been employed though this is difficult to assess since children tend to improve with age. Any affected child undergoing major surgery should have a supply of irradiated blood to avoid graft-versus-host disease until immunocompetence has been demonstrated. Clefts may be submucous and should be sought. Speech therapy and additional educational assistance may be needed. Cardiac defects are the usual focus of clinical management. Early echocardiography is essential in any child where other features suggest the diagnosis. Markert et al. (1999) treated 5 infants with the complete DiGeorge syndrome by transplantation of allogeneic, postnatal thymus tissue. All of them had severely reduced T-cell function. Their peripheral blood mononuclear cells did not respond to mitogens. After transplantation of thymus tissue, T-cell proliferative responses to mitogens developed in 4 patients. No graft-vs-host disease or graft rejection was detected, even in a case with full haplotype mismatch. Two of the patients survived with restoration of immune function, 11 months and 5.5 years after transplantation, respectively; 3 patients died from infection or abnormalities unrelated to transplantation. The authors concluded that early thymus transplantation (before the development of infectious complications) may promote successful immune reconstitution in the complete DiGeorge syndrome. POPULATION GENETICS A preliminary population study in the Northern region of England, which has a birth population of 40,000 per annum, revealed 9 cases born in 1993 with 22q11 deletions who presented with neonatal features. One of these was familial with an asymptomatic carrier father. The overall birth prevalence appeared to be at least 1 in 4,000 (Burn et al., 1995). Goodship et al. (1998) presented prospective prevalence data derived from the same health region. Since approximately 75% of patients with 22q11 deletion have a cardiac abnormality, all infants with significant congenital heart disease born in 1994 and 1995 who were referred to the Northern (United Kingdom) Genetics Service were screened for 22q11 deletion. Significant congenital heart disease was defined as major structural malformation or disease requiring early invasive investigation or intervention. Additional cases born during this period without apparent heart malformation in whom a diagnosis of 22q11 deletion was made by a clinical geneticist were included. Among 69,129 live births there were 207 babies with significant congenital heart disease; fluorescence in situ hybridization analyses were performed in 170 of these. Five of these had 22q11 deletions. One baby with type B interruption of the aortic arch, ventricular septal defect, and 22q11 deletion was diagnosed at autopsy following sudden death at 11 days. Three further infants were diagnosed on the basis of a laryngeal web and hypocalcemia, dysmorphism, and dysmorphism with nasal voice, respectively. The minimum birth prevalence from this data was 13 per 100,000 live births, making 22q11 deletion the second most common cause of congenital heart disease after Down syndrome. ANIMAL MODEL Lindsay et al. (1999) created an animal model for the DiGeorge syndrome using Cre-loxP chromosome engineering to delete a portion of mouse chromosome 16B that is homologous to human chromosome 22q11. At birth, heterozygous deleted mice were recovered at the predicted mendelian ratio, but no homozygous deleted mice were recovered. Deleted mice that survived on the first day of life were viable and fertile and grew normally. Forty-two deleted embryos were examined at 18.5 days postcoitum; 26% of them had cardiovascular abnormalities. The most common abnormality (found in 6 embryos) was retroesophageal right subclavian artery, which originated from the descending aorta, dorsal to the emergence of the left subclavian artery. In examining 56 adult deleted mice, they found that 18% had cardiovascular abnormalities. Lindsay et al. (1999) traced the embryologic origin of these abnormalities to defective development of the fourth pharyngeal arch arteries. Unlike patients with DiGeorge syndrome, deleted mice had normal levels of calcium, phosphorus, and parathyroid hormone, and normal percentages of B and T cells. The thymus was normal in size. In addition, no deleted mice had cleft palate or gross palatal abnormalities. Lindsay et al. (1999) genetically complemented the deletion using a chromosome carrying a duplication of the deleted region. Genetic complementation corrected the heart defects, indicating that they are caused by reduced dosage of genes located within the deleted region. Puech et al. (2000) used Cre-mediated recombination of LoxP sites in embryonic stem cells and mice to generate a 550-kb deletion encompassing 16 of the 27 genes that had been found in a 1.5-Mb region of 22q11 in the corresponding region of mouse chromosome 16. Mice heterozygous for this deletion were normal and exhibited no cardiovascular abnormalities. Lindsay et al. (2001) used a combination of chromosome engineering and P1 artificial chromosome transgenesis to localize the gene in mouse chromosome 16 haploinsufficiency for which causes the cardiovascular phenotype described by Lindsay et al. (1999). Lindsay et al. (2001) showed that Tbx1 (602054), a member of the T-box transcription factor family, is required for normal development of the pharyngeal arch arteries in a gene dosage-dependent manner. Deletion of 1 copy of Tbx1 affects the development of the fourth pharyngeal arch arteries, whereas homozygous mutation severely disrupts the entire pharyngeal arch artery system. Lindsay et al. (2001) concluded that haploinsufficiency of Tbx1 is sufficient to generate at least 1 important component of the DiGeorge syndrome phenotype in mice. Their data demonstrated the suitability of the mouse for the genetic dissection of microdeletion syndromes. Jerome and Papaioannou (2001) investigated the potential role of the Tbx1 gene in the causation of the DiGeorge syndrome phenotype. This gene, which encodes a transcription factor of the T-box family, maps to 22q11. They produced a null mutation of the Tbx1 gene in mice and found that mice heterozygous for the mutation had a high incidence of cardiac outflow tract anomalies, thus modeling one of the major abnormalities of the human syndrome. Moreover, Tbx1 -/- mice displayed a wide range of developmental anomalies encompassing almost all of the common DGS/VCFS features, including hypoplasia of the thymus and parathyroid glands, cardiac outflow tract abnormalities, abnormal facial structures, abnormal vertebrae, and cleft palate. On the basis of this phenotype in mice, Jerome and Papaioannou (2001) proposed that TBX1 in humans is an etiology of DGS/VCFS. To investigate the etiology of VCFS/DGS, Merscher et al. (2001) used a Cre-loxP strategy to generate mice that were hemizygous for a 1.5-Mb deletion corresponding to that on 22q11 in VCFS/DGS patients. These mice exhibited significant perinatal lethality and had conotruncal and parathyroid defects. The conotruncal defects could be partially rescued by a human BAC containing the TBX1 gene. Mice heterozygous for a null mutation in Tbx1 developed conotruncal defects. These results together with the expression patterns of TBX1 suggested a major role for the TBX1 gene in the molecular etiology of VCFS/DGS. Funke et al. (2001) reported that mice overexpressing 4 transgenes (PNUTL1, 602724; GP1BB, 138720; TBX1, 602054; and WDR14) had chronic otitis media, a hyperactive circling behavior, and sensorineural hearing loss. This was associated with middle and inner ear malformations analogous to human Mondini dysplasia, reported to occur in VCFS/DGS patients. Based upon its pattern of expression in the ear and functional studies of the gene, the authors hypothesized that Tbx1 likely plays a central role in the etiology of ear defects in these mice, and that haploinsufficiency of TBX1 may be responsible for ear disorders in VCFS/DGS patients. The CRKL gene (602007) encodes an SH2-SH3-SH3 adaptor protein closely related to the Crk (164762) gene products. CRKL maps within the common deletion region for DGS/VCFS. Guris et al. (2001) reported that mice homozygous for a targeted null mutation at the Crkl locus exhibited defects in multiple cranial and cardiac neural crest derivatives including the cranial ganglia, aortic arch arteries, cardiac outflow tract, thymus, parathyroid glands, and craniofacial structures. They showed that the migration and early expansion of the neural crest cells is unaffected in Crkl -/- embryos. Guris et al. (2001) concluded that the similarity between the Crkl -/- phenotype and the clinical manifestations of DGS/VCFS implicate defects in CRKL-mediated signaling pathways as part of the molecular mechanism underlying this syndrome. Schinke and Izumo (2001) reviewed the genetic structure of the 22q11 region associated with DGS and the syntenic region of mouse chromosome 16. The gene order is inverted between human and mouse in a segment of this region. A table accompanying the figure summarized the phenotypes of mice homozygous or heterozygous mutant for chromosomal deletions or gene mutations of specific regions. Lindsay and Baldini (2001) showed that in their mouse deletion model Df1, the aortic arch patterning defects that occur in heterozygous deletion mice (Df1/+) are associated with a differentiation impairment of vascular smooth muscle in the 4th pharyngeal arch arteries (PAAs) during early embryogenesis. As in humans, not all deletion mice presented with cardiovascular defects at birth. However, all Df1/+ embryos have abnormally small 4th PAAs during early embryogenesis, but many embryos later overcome this early defect, coincident with the appearance of vascular smooth muscle differentiation. The authors speculated that embryos born with aortic arch patterning defects probably represent a more severely affected group that fails to attain sufficient 4th PAA growth for normal remodeling of the PAA system. Paylor et al. (2001) showed that Df1/+ mice have deficits in sensorimotor gating, learning, and memory. The finding of sensorimotor gating deficits is particularly significant because DGS patients with schizophrenia and schizotypal personality disorder show similar deficits. Vermot et al. (2003) generated mice bearing a hypomorphic allele of the gene encoding the retinoic acid-synthesizing enzyme RALDH2 (603687). The resulting mutant mice, which died perinatally, exhibited features of DiGeorge syndrome with heart outflow tract septation defects and anomalies of the aortic arch-derived head and neck arteries, laryngeal-tracheal cartilage defects, and thyroid/parathyroid aplasia or hypoplasia. Analysis of the Raldh2 hypomorph embryos showed selective defects of the posterior (third to sixth) branchial arches, including absence or hypoplasia of the corresponding aortic arches and pharyngeal pouches, and local downregulation of retinoic acid-target genes. Thus, a decreased level of embryonic retinoic acid (through genetic and/or nutritional causes) could represent a major modifier of the expressivity of human 22q11del-associated DiGeorge/velocardiofacial syndromes and, if severe enough, could on its own lead to the clinical features of the DiGeorge syndrome. HISTORY The original description of the syndrome was derived from a published discussion at an immunology meeting (Cooper et al., 1965). DiGeorge (1968) published a formal report 3 years later. The report by Strong (1968) predated this formal report and probably represents the same variable disorder. Kimura (1977) reported velopharyngeal deficiency in a series of patients without cleft palate. The Japanese language report by Kinouchi et al. (1976) and the English reports, by Takao et al. (1980)and Shimizu et al. (1984), delineated the syndrome in the Japanese population. The acronym CATCH22 derives from the phrase Catch 22, which was used by Joseph Heller as the title of his book (Heller, 1962).

comment: DESCRIPTION Titin, or connectin, is a giant muscle protein expressed in the cardiac and skeletal muscles that spans half of the sarcomere from Z-line to M-line. Titin plays a key role in muscle assembly, force transmission at the Z-line, and maintenance of resting tension in the I-band region (Itoh-Satoh et al., 2002). CLONING Labeit et al. (1990) showed that partial titin cDNAs encode a regular pattern of 2 types of 100-residue motif, each of which probably folds into a separate domain type. Such motifs are present in several evolutionarily divergent proteins, all of which are likely to interact with myosin. Labeit and Kolmerer (1995) determined the cDNA sequence of human cardiac titin. The 82-kb cDNA predicted a 26,926-amino acid protein with a molecular mass of 2,993 kD. Ninety percent of the mass is contained in a repetitive structure composed of 244 copies of 100-residue repeats that encode 112 immunoglobulin-like and 132 fibronectin type III domains. Alternative splicing accounts for tissue-specific titin isoforms. In the central part of I-band titin, cardiac and skeletal titins branch into distinct isoforms; in heart, differential splicing includes about 3.5 kb of cDNA within the I-band region of titin, whereas in skeletal muscle, 22.5 kb of cDNA is included. In addition, a sequence element rich in proline (P), glutamic acid (E), lysine (K), and valine (V) residues, referred to as the PEVK domain, comprises 163 residues in cardiac titin and 2,174 residues in skeletal titin. Bang et al. (2001) determined that the complete sequence of human titin encodes a 38,138-amino acid protein with a molecular mass of 4,200 kD. GENE STRUCTURE Bang et al. (2001) determined that titin has 363 exons. GENE FUNCTION Labeit et al. (1990) suggested that the I-band of titin makes elastic connections between the thick filament and the Z-line within the sarcomere. The A-band of titin appears to bind to the thick filament, where it may regulate filament length and assembly. The architecture of sequences in the A-band region of titin suggested to Labeit and Kolmerer (1995) why thick filament structure is conserved among vertebrates. In the I-band region, comparison of titin sequences from muscles of different passive tension identified 2 elements that correlate with tissue stiffness, suggesting that titin may act as 2 springs in series. The differential expression of the springs provides a molecular explanation for the diversity of sarcomere length and resting tension in vertebrate striated muscles. Li et al. (2002) used protein engineering and single-molecule atomic force microscopy to examine the mechanical components that form the elastic region of human cardiac titin. They showed that when these mechanical elements are combined, they explain the macroscopic behavior of titin in intact muscle. Ma and Wang (2002) presented evidence that the PEVK segment of titin, which contains numerous SH3-binding motifs, and the Z-line protein myopalladin (MYPN; 608517) may play signaling roles in targeting and orienting nebulin (NEB; 161650) to the Z-line during sarcomere assembly. The I-band region of titin contains tandem arrays of immunoglobulin domains. Immunoglobulin domain-27 (I27) unfolds through an intermediate under force in which the A-strand is detached. The lengthening of I27 without unfolding forms a stable intermediate that is believed to be an important component of titin elasticity (Marszalek et al., 1999). Williams et al. (2003) used mutant titins to study the role of the partly unfolded intermediate of titin. Under physiologic forces, the partly unfolded intermediate of immunoglobulin domain-27 does not contribute to mechanical strength. Williams et al. (2003) also proposed a unified forced unfolding model of all I27 analogs studied, and concluded that I27 can withstand higher forces in muscle than had previously been predicted. Titin interacts with many sarcomeric proteins: telethonin (TCAP; 604488) and alpha-actinin (e.g., 102575) at the Z-line region; calpain-3 (CAPN3; 114240) and obscurin (OBSCN; 608616) at the I-band region; and myosin-binding protein C (MYBPC3; 600958), calmodulin (CALM1; 114180), and CAPN3 at the M-line region (Bang et al., 2001). In a review, Hackman et al. (2003) noted that titin has at least 2 different CAPN3-binding sites: one is in region N2A in I-band titin and the other is in the Mex5 exon of M-line titin. Obscurin (608616) interacts with both the NH2-terminal of Z-disc titin and the M-line titin during different phases of myofibrillogenesis, and MURF1 (606131) binds titin close to the kinase domain at the periphery of the M-line titin. Lange et al. (2005) identified a signaling complex where the titin protein kinase domain (TK) interacts with the zinc finger protein NBR1 (166945) through a mechanically inducible conformation. NBR1 targets the ubiquitin-associated p62/SQSTM1 (601530) to sarcomeres, and p62 in turn interacts with MURF2 (606469), a muscle-specific RING-B-box E3 ligase and ligand of the transactivation domain of the serum response transcription factor (SRF; 600589). Nuclear translocation of MURF2 was induced by mechanical inactivity and caused reduction of nuclear SRF and repression of transcription. MAPPING By studies of DNA from a panel of Chinese hamster/human hybrid cell lines, Labeit et al. (1990) assigned the TTN locus to 2q13-q33. Another myofibrillar protein, nebulin, maps to 2q31-q32. The fact that the 2 genes are close together suggests that their regulation may be coordinated, possibly to control the ratio of the proteins. In the mouse, the titin gene was also mapped to chromosome 2. Muller-Seitz et al. (1993) showed that the murine equivalents of the human TTN, NEB, and CHRNA1 (100690) genes are all on mouse chromosome 2. Using radiation hybrid mapping, Pelin et al. (1997) reassigned the titin gene to the vicinity of the markers D2S384 and D2S364 on 2q24.3. They concluded that the TTN gene lies outside the candidate region for NEM2 (256030), the autosomal recessive form of nemaline myopathy. MOLECULAR GENETICS - Cardiomyopathy In 1 of 82 patients with hypertrophic cardiomyopathy who had no mutation in known disease genes, Satoh et al. (1999) identified a mutation in the TTN gene (188840.0001) that was not found in more than 500 normal chromosomes and increased the binding affinity of titin to alpha-actinin (see 102575) in the yeast 2-hybrid assay. The form of hypertrophic cardiomyopathy due to mutation in the TTN gene has arbitrarily been designated CMH9. In 2 unrelated families with autosomal dominant dilated cardiomyopathy linked to 2q31 (CMD1G; 604145), Gerull et al. (2002) identified 2 different heterozygous mutations in the TTN gene (188840.0002; 188840.0003). - Muscular Dystrophy Tibial muscular dystrophy (TMD; 600334) is an autosomal dominant late-onset distal myopathy characterized by weakness and atrophy usually confined to the anterior compartment of the lower leg. Cardiomyopathy has not been diagnosed in patients with TMD. In 81 Finnish patients with TMD from 12 unrelated families, Hackman et al. (2002) identified an 11-bp deletion (188840.0004) in Mex6, the last exon (exon 363) of the TTN gene. Mex6 encodes an Ig domain that, in situ, is localized at the periphery of the M-line lattice. Mex6 and Mex5 are in the region determining the calpain-3 binding site of M-line titin. Three patients with a more severe phenotype, limb-girdle muscular dystrophy type 2J (LGMD2J; 608807), were homozygous for the 11-bp deletion. In a French family with TMD, a leu34315-to-pro mutation in Mex6 (188840.0005) was discovered. Lange et al. (2005) found a mutation in the titin protein kinase domain that results in Edstrom myopathy (603689). ANIMAL MODEL The zebrafish embryo is transparent and can tolerate absence of blood flow because its oxygen is delivered by diffusion rather than by the cardiovascular system. It is, therefore, possible to attribute cardiac failure directly to particular genes by ruling out the possibility that it is due to a secondary effect of hypoxia. Xu et al. (2002) studied a recessive lethal mutation, called 'pickwick' (pik), discovered in a large-scale genetic screen. The heart of the pik mutant develops normally but is poorly contractile from the first beat. Aside from the edema that inevitably accompanies cardiac dysfunction, development is normal during the first 3 days. Xu et al. (2002) showed by positional cloning that the 'causative' mutation is in an alternatively spliced exon of the titin gene. Titin is the biggest known protein and spans the half-sarcomere from the Z-disc to M-line in heart and skeletal muscle. It appears to provide a scaffold for the assembly of thick and thin filaments and to provide elastic recoil engendered by stretch during diastole. Xu et al. (2002) found that nascent myofibrils form in pik mutants, but normal sarcomeres are absent. Mutant cells transplanted to wildtype hearts remained thin and bulged outwards as individual cell aneurysms without affecting nearby wildtype cardiomyocytes, indicating that the contractile deficiency is cell-autonomous. Absence of titin function thus results in blockage of sarcomere assembly and causes a functional disorder resembling human dilated cardiomyopathies, one form of which was shown to be caused in the human by mutations in the TTN gene (Gerull et al., 2002). Muscular dystrophy with myositis (mdm) is a recessive mouse mutation that causes severe and progressive muscular degeneration. Garvey et al. (2002) identified the mdm mutation as a complex rearrangement that includes a deletion and LINE insertion in the titin gene. Mutant allele-specific splicing results in the deletion of 83 amino acids from the N2A region of TTN, a domain thought to bind CAPN3. Western blot analysis detected a 50 to 60% reduction in the amount of CAPN3 in affected muscles. Garvey et al. (2002) concluded that the mdm mouse is a model for tibial muscular dystrophy.

comment: DESCRIPTION The E2F transcription factor family (see 189971) regulates the expression of various cellular promoters, particularly those involved in the cell cycle. E2F factors bind to DNA as homodimers or heterodimers in association with dimerization partner DP1. TFDP1 may be the first example of a family of related transcription factors; see TFDP2 (602160). CLONING The cDNA for transcription factor DP1 (TFDP1) was cloned by Girling et al. (1993) from a library of F9 embryonal carcinoma cells by using PCR primers predicted from partial peptide sequences of a 46-kD protein. The protein was isolated by virtue of its binding to a DNA sequence taken from the adenovirus E2A promoter. TFDP1 is a component of the DRTF1/E2F transcription factor complex, which coordinates events in the cell cycle by interacting with RB1 (180200), the retinoblastoma gene product, and RB-related proteins (Bandara and La Thangue, 1991). DRTF1 activity is downregulated in differentiating embryonal carcinoma cells, and E2F activity is induced in adenovirus-infected HeLa cells. Bandara and La Thangue (1991) showed that the adenovirus E1a protein causes the dissociation of the RB protein from this complex. TFDP1 has a predicted sequence of 410 amino acids (Girling et al., 1993) with a region of similarity to E2F1 (189971), accounting for the ability of both to bind the same DNA sequence. GENE FUNCTION SMAD3 (603109) is a direct mediator of transcriptional activation by the TGF-beta (190180) receptor (see 190181). Its target genes in epithelial cells include cyclin-dependent kinase (CDK; see 116953) inhibitors that generate a cytostatic response. Chen et al. (2002) defined how, in the same context, SMAD3 can mediate transcriptional repression of the growth-promoting gene MYC (190080). A complex containing SMAD3, the transcription factors E2F4 (600659), E2F5 (600967), and DP1, and the corepressor p107 (116957) preexists in the cytoplasm. In response to TGF-beta, this complex moves into the nucleus and associates with SMAD4 (600993), recognizing a composite SMAD-E2F site on MYC for repression. Previously known as the ultimate recipients of CDK regulatory signals, E2F4/E2F5 and p107 act here as transducers of TGF-beta receptor signals upstream of CDK. SMAD proteins therefore mediate transcriptional activation or repression depending on their associated partners. MAPPING In a study mapping the human SOX1 gene (602148) to 13q34 by fluorescence in situ hybridization, Malas et al. (1997) demonstrated that the TFDP1 gene maps distal to SOX1 on 13q34. Zhang et al. (1997) used fluorescence in situ hybridization to map the TFDP1 gene to human chromosome 13q34. They noted the presence of a pseudogene, termed TFDP1P, at 1q32.3.

comment: VATER is a mnemonically useful acronym for vertebral defects, anal atresia, tracheoesophageal fistula with esophageal atresia, and radial dysplasia. This combination of associated defects was pointed out by Quan and Smith (1972). Nearly all cases have been sporadic, with no recognized teratogen or chromosomal abnormality. Auchterlonie and White (1982) described a family in which 1 brother had esophageal atresia and hemivertebrae D6-12, and a second brother had esophageal and duodenal atresia, absent rectum and anus, ventricular septal defect and renal agenesis with Potter facies and hypoplastic lungs. Other familial instances were reviewed. See 107480 for a partial syndrome. Iafolla et al. (1991) described 3 patients with hydrocephalus secondary to aqueductal stenosis in addition to the multisystemic features of the VATER association. One patient died in the neonatal period due to respiratory failure, but 2 survived (30 months and 19 months) after early neurosurgical intervention. The authors cautioned against labeling the VATER and hydrocephalus association (276950) as a uniformly lethal or developmentally devastating disorder. The VATER association was later expanded to the VACTERL association. VACTERL is an acronym for vertebral anomalies (similar to those of spondylocostal dysplasia), anal atresia, cardiac malformations, tracheoesophageal fistula, renal anomalies (urethral atresia with hydronephrosis), and limb anomalies (hexadactyly, humeral hypoplasia, radial aplasia, and proximally placed thumb). Khoury et al. (1983) reported a population study of the VACTERL association. The MURCS association (601076) also includes vertebral anomalies. MURCS is an acronym for the leading features, namely, Mullerian duct aplasia, renal aplasia, and cervicothoracic somite dysplasia. Damian et al. (1996) claimed to have described the first report of a precise molecular basis for a case of VACTERL. They studied a family in which a female infant with VACTERL was born in 1977 and died at age 1 month due to renal failure. Because her mother and sister later developed classic mitochondrial cytopathy associated with the A-to-G point mutation at nucleotide position 3243 of mitochondrial DNA (590050.0001), they performed molecular analysis of mtDNA in preserved kidney tissue from the VACTERL case. They discovered 100% mutant mtDNA in multicystic and 32% mutant mtDNA in normal kidney tissue. Mild deficiency of complex I respiratory chain enzyme activity was found in the mother's muscle biopsy. Other maternal relatives were healthy but had low levels of mutant mtDNA in blood. Nezarati and McLeod (1999) described a mother and son with typical VACTERL anomalies. The index patient was born by cesarean section to a 27-year-old gravida 1 mother following an uncomplicated pregnancy. Cesarean section was performed because of 'failure to progress.' At birth he was found to have an asymmetric crying face, preaxial polydactyly on the right, a small midmuscular ventricular septal defect with an incomplete right bundle branch block, a small cleft in the T3 vertebrae, and incomplete development of the left half of the sacrum. The kidneys were normal ultrasonographically. The patient's mother was born with an H-type tracheoesophageal fistula, imperforate anus, rectovaginal fistula, a triphalangeal thumb, hypoplastic left kidney, and vertebral anomalies. There were no other individuals with VACTERL anomalies in the family. No families with VACTERL association in the offspring of an affected individual had previously been reported. Occasional single anomalies of the VACTERL association had been described in sibs of parents of the affected individuals. Hattori et al. (1999) emphasized the tracheobronchial anomalies, specifically ectopic bronchus, in VATER association. They described an 11-month-old boy who presented with recurrent wheezing and atelectasis in the right upper lobe of the lung. Bronchoscopy and bronchography confirmed the presence of an ectopic bronchus arising from the right main bronchus. The diagnosis of VATER association was made on the basis of multiple vertebral and rib anomalies, imperforate anus with a perineal fistula, unilateral hydronephrosis, atrial septal defect, and a preauricular tag; the patient did not have tracheoesophageal fistula. From their mutant analysis of Gli genes (see 165220), which encode transcription factors mediating sonic hedgehog (SHH; 600725) signal transduction, Kim et al. (2001) observed that defective Shh signaling leads to a spectrum of developmental anomalies in mice strikingly similar to those of VACTERL. They proposed that VACTERL could be caused by defective SHH signaling during human embryogenesis and suggested that the Gli mutant mice can serve as useful models for studying the pathogenesis of VACTERL.

comment: A number sign (#) is used with this entry because this phenotype is caused by mutation in more than 1 gene. Mutation in the MYH7 gene (160760), which maps to chromosome 14q12, causes the form referred to as CMH1. The form that maps to 1q32 caused by mutation in the TNNT2 gene (191045) is referred to as CMH2 (115195). CMH3 (115196) is caused by mutation in the TPM1 gene (191010), which resides on 15q22.1. CMH4 (115197) is caused by mutation in the MYBPC3 gene (600958), which resides on 11p11.2. The CMH6 locus (600858) has been mapped to 7q31-qter by linkage analysis of affected families. Forms referred to as CMH7, CMH8, CMH9, and CMH10 are caused by mutation in the TNNI3 (191044), MYL3 (160790), TTN (188840), and MYL2 (160781) genes, respectively; these genes map to 19q13.4, 3p, 2q24.3, and 12q23-q24. Additionally, mutation in the gene encoding cardiac actin (102540.0003), which maps to 15q14, was shown to cause familial hypertrophic cardiomyopathy. A form of hypertrophic cardiomyopathy can be caused by mutation in the gene encoding cardiac myosin light-peptide kinase (MYLK2; 606566), which resides on chromosome 20q13.3, and another form can be caused by mutation in the gene encoding caveolin-3 (CAV3; 601253.0013), which maps to chromosome 3p25. Hypertrophic cardiomyopathy can be caused by mutation in the MYH6 gene (160710), encoding cardiac myosin heavy chain-alpha and mapping to chromosome 14q12. Hypertrophic cardiomyopathy has also been observed with mutations in genes encoding mitochondrial tRNAs; see mitochondrial tRNA-glycine (MTTG; 590035) and mitochondrial tRNA-isoleucine (MTTI; 590045). DESCRIPTION Hereditary ventricular hypertrophy (CMH1, ASH, or IHSS) in early stages produces a presystolic gallop due to an atrial heart sound, and EKG changes of ventricular hypertrophy. Progressive ventricular outflow obstruction may cause palpitation associated with arrhythmia, congestive heart failure, and sudden death. Seidman (2000) reviewed studies of hypertrophic cardiomyopathy in man and mouse. CLINICAL FEATURES In the first demonstration of asymmetric hypertrophy of the heart in young adults, Teare (1958) reported the autopsy findings in 9 cases of sudden death in young subjects distributed in 6 families. This condition has been called muscular subaortic stenosis but more generalized ventricular hypertrophy is often an earlier and more impressive feature, and obstruction to outflow from the right ventricle can also occur. Study of the families of probands with the full-blown condition shows that an atrial heart sound ('presystolic gallop') and EKG changes of ventricular hypertrophy are the earliest signs. Sudden death occurs in some cases. Braunwald et al. (1964) reported in detail on 64 patients; multiple cases were observed in 11 families, which contained in all at least 41 definite or probable cases. As pointed out by Nasser et al. (1967), outflow obstruction may be absent in some affected members of families in which others do have outflow obstruction. Maron et al. (1974) studied 4 infants that died with ASH in the first 5 months of life, including 1 stillborn. ASH was demonstrated in one first-degree relative of each infant. Maron et al. (1976) analyzed the clinical picture of 46 children with ASH. On the basis of a study of an outpatient population, Spirito et al. (1989) suggested that the prognosis in hypertrophic cardiomyopathy may be less grave than has usually been considered on the basis of hospital-study patients. On morphologic grounds, 4 types of hypertrophic cardiomyopathy have been described: type 1 with hypertrophy confined to the anterior segment of the ventricular septum; type 2 with hypertrophy of both the anterior and the posterior segments of the ventricular septum; type 3 with involvement of both the ventricular septum and the free wall of the left ventricle and type 4 with involvement of the posterior segment of the septum, the anterolateral free wall, or the apical half of the septum (Maron et al., 1982; Ciro et al., 1983). Apical hypertrophic cardiomyopathy is, therefore, one form of type IV. It was first described by Yamaguchi et al. (1979) in Japan (where it appears to be more frequent than elsewhere) and later by Maron et al. (1982). The cases of apical hypertrophic cardiomyopathy described by Maron et al. (1982) belonged to families with different forms of hypertrophic cardiomyopathy. Malouf et al. (1985) reported apical hypertrophic cardiomyopathy in father and daughter of a Lebanese Christian family. The parents were not related; an only sib was normal on examination and echocardiogram as were 2 sisters of the father and their 6 children. In a metaanalysis of sudden death from cardiac causes in children and young adults, Liberthson (1996) found that hypertrophic cardiomyopathy was the most frequent cause of sudden death in young persons in association with strenuous physical exertion or sports. OTHER FEATURES Maron et al. (1996) collected information on 158 sudden deaths that had occurred in trained athletes throughout the United States from 1985 through 1995. In 24 athletes (15%), noncardiovascular causes were found. Among the 134 athletes who had cardiovascular causes of sudden death, the median age was 17 years. The most common competitive sports involved were basketball (47 cases) and football (45 cases), together accounting for 68% of sudden deaths. The most common structural cardiovascular diseases identified at autopsy as the primary cause of death were hypertrophic cardiomyopathy (48 athletes, 36%), which was disproportionately prevalent in black athletes compared with white athletes (48% vs 26% of deaths; P = 0.01), and malformations involving anomalous coronary artery origin (17 athletes, 13%). Of 115 athletes who had a standard preparticipation medical evaluation, only 4 (3%) were suspected of having cardiovascular disease, and the cardiovascular anomaly responsible for sudden death was correctly identified in only 1 athlete (0.9%). In a series of 387 young athletes who died suddenly, Maron (2003) found that hypertropic cardiomyopathy was the cause in 102 (26.4%). Coronary artery anomalies had accounted for 53 (13.7%) and ruptured aortic aneurysm of Marfan syndrome for 12 (3.1%). Arrhythmogenic right ventricular cardiomyopathy was found in 11 (2.8%) and long QT syndrome in 3 (0.8%). Cannon (2003) tabulated the features of hypertrophic cardiomyopathy that increase the risk of cardiovascular events. These included family history of sudden death, recurrent syncope, ventricular tachycardia on monitoring, extreme left ventricular hypertrophy (more than 3 cm), left ventricular outflow pressure gradient of more than 30 mm Hg, and fall in blood pressure during exercise. INHERITANCE In the family reported by Horlick et al. (1966), 10 persons in 4 generations were thought to have been affected. Pare et al. (1961) described this disorder in 30 out of 87 members of a French-Canadian kindred. The genealogic survey was carried back to the original emigrant from France in the 1600s. The pattern of occurrence over 5 generations and 160 years since the death of the man believed to be the first instance of the heart disease indicated autosomal dominant inheritance. Elevated paternal age of sporadic (possible fresh mutation) cases was observed by Jorgensen (1968). The family study of Clark et al. (1973), using echocardiography, indicated that 28 of 30 probands (93%) had an affected parent. This agrees well with estimates of the extent to which this disorder, on the average, reduces reproductive fitness. Greaves et al. (1987) performed echocardiographic studies of 193 first-degree relatives of 50 patients with hypertrophic cardiomyopathy. More males than females were affected. In 28 of 50 families, familial occurrence was observed. In 15 families the pattern of inheritance was consistent with autosomal dominant inheritance; in the other 13 the affected members were in a single generation and the pattern of inheritance could not be determined. The family reported by Yamaguchi et al. (1979) suggested X-linked recessive inheritance. Burn (1985) felt that the existence of a recessive form of hypertrophic cardiomyopathy (Emanuel et al., 1971; Branzi et al., 1985) could neither be established nor disproved at the time of his writing. Branzi et al. (1985) claimed the existence of an autosomal recessive form because of a family they found with 2 affected sisters and both parents normal by careful study. Formal segregation analysis supported the existence of 2 classes: one with a segregation ratio close to 50% and one with a value close to 25%. MAPPING Darsee et al. (1979) found a lod score of 7.7 for linkage between ASH and HLA. They concluded that, in addition to the hereditary form linked to HLA, a sporadic unlinked form is associated with severe systemic hypertension. White patients with ASH were B12; black patients were B5. This presumably strong evidence placing a gene for hypertrophic subaortic stenosis on 6p by linkage to HLA was invalidated when the infamous John R. Darsee confessed fabrication of the data. Nutter also published a retraction. Motulsky (1979) wrote a laudatory editorial to accompany the original article. In his retraction letter, Darsee stated: 'The lod scores were calculated, in part, by one of the journal referees who felt they should be included, and partly by my own calculations. The biometrist I consulted at Emory regarding these calculations was not familiar with lod scores and unable to provide assistance.' Before Darsee confessed, Darsee and Heymsfield (1981) wrote: 'It is the pinhole through which we are forced to view this disease or these diseases that has helped confer a degree of homogeneity. The pinhole is the limited collection of tools we have to study hypertrophic cardiomyopathy--the angiogram, the echocardiogram, and the autopsy table. It is a common practice of even the most perspicacious and critical investigators to conclude that diseases that look the same on canvas were painted with the same brush.' Although these words are true in general terms and are a fine statement of the principle of genetic heterogeneity, the falsified data do not support them, of course. Jarcho et al. (1989) did studies with DNA markers in the Canadian family originally reported by Pare et al. (1961). At the time of the study, hypertrophic cardiomyopathy had occurred in 20 surviving and 24 deceased family members. With a polymorphic DNA probe with the trivial name CRI-L436, which identified a DNA segment designated D14S26, they found no recombination (lod score = 9.37 at theta = 0). This probe had been assigned to chromosome 14 on the basis of somatic cell hybrid analysis (Donis-Keller et al., 1987). The gene encoding the alpha chain of the T-cell receptor (186880) was located approximately 20 cM from D14S26 (Mitchell et al., 1989). Solomon et al. (1990) mapped the probe CRI-L436 to 14q11-q12 by in situ hybridization. Because the cardiac myosin heavy chain genes (MYH6, 160710; MYH7) map to the same chromosomal band, they determined the genetic distance between the gene for the beta heavy chain of cardiac myosin, D14S26, and the CMH1 locus. They presented data indicating that these 3 loci are linked within 5 cM of each other. The data were consistent with the possibility that the CMH1 mutation is in either the alpha or the beta gene. Hejtmancik et al. (1991) found that the gene for familial hypertrophic cardiomyopathy was located at 14q1 in 8 unrelated families of varied ethnic origins. Of 5 families with hypertrophic cardiomyopathy, Epstein et al. (1992) found linkage to chromosome 14 markers in one and suggestive linkage in a second. However, linkage to chromosome 14 markers was excluded in the other 3 kindreds. Ko et al. (1992) excluded linkage to D14S26 in a Chinese family, likewise indicating genetic heterogeneity. See 160760.0001 for a description of the molecular defect in chromosome 14-linked hypertrophic cardiomyopathy (symbolized CMH1). MOLECULAR GENETICS - Diagnosis To screen for mutations that cause familial hypertrophic cardiomyopathy, Rosenzweig et al. (1991) capitalized on the fact that 'ectopic' or 'illegitimate' transcription of beta cardiac myosin heavy chain gene can be detected in blood lymphocytes. Preclinical or prenatal screening will make it possible to study the disorder longitudinally and to develop preventive interventions. The findings again illustrate the important application of PCR. Clarke and Harper (1992) suggested that 'the parallels between this cardiomyopathy and Huntington's disease are sufficiently striking that we would be very cautious about testing for it in childhood. The emotional consequences of being brought up under a cloud of doom may be damaging, and the lack of any uncertainty in identifying gene carriers by mutation analysis might paradoxically make this worse.' Watkins et al. (1992) countered this view, saying that children with the condition face a 4 to 6% risk of sudden death each year. Genetic diagnosis will allow evaluation of prophylactic use of antiarrhythmic agents or implantable defibrillator devices. It will also provide parents and physicians an appropriate basis on which to make decisions regarding the participation of children in competitive sports. They suggested that in their experience '...any perception of a cloud of doom comes as much from a lack of knowledge of and research into this inherited cardiomyopathy as from anything else.' To provide a method of genetic diagnosis of cardiomyopathy, Mogensen et al. (2001) developed a method of linkage analysis using multiplex PCR of markers covering 9 loci associated with familial hypertrophic cardiomyopathy. They evaluated this method in 3 families. In all 3 families the locus showing the highest lod score was subsequently found by mutation analysis to be the locus at which the disease-causing gene was found. Mogensen et al. (2001) emphasized the importance of stringent phenotypic definitions in the diagnostic process. - Phenotype/Genotype Fananapazir et al. (1993) demonstrated by biopsy of the soleus muscle the presence of central core disease of skeletal muscle (117000) in association with hypertrophic cardiomyopathy due to any of 4 different mutations in the MYH7 gene. Soleus muscle samples from patients in 4 kindreds in which hypertrophic cardiomyopathy was not linked to the MYH7 locus showed no myopathy or central core disease. In 1 family with the leu908-to-val mutation of the MYH7 gene (160760.0010), central core disease was demonstrated on soleus muscle biopsy, although cardiac hypertrophy was absent on echocardiogram in 2 adults and 3 children. Almost all patients had no significant muscle weakness, despite the histologic changes. Atiga et al. (2000) studied 36 patients with CMH1 using beat-to-beat QT variability analysis. This technique quantifies the beat-to-beat fluctuations in ventricular repolarization reflected in the QT interval. Seven mutations were found in this group: 9 patients had the 'severe' arg403-to-gln mutation (160760.0001) and 8 had the more benign leu908-to-val mutation (160760.0010). Atiga et al. (2000) found higher QT variability indices in patients with CMH1 compared with controls, and the greatest abnormality was observed in patients with the arg403-to-gln mutation. CMH1 patients therefore exhibited labile ventricular repolarization and were considered to be at higher risk of sudden death from ventricular arrhythmias, particularly those with a 'severe' mutation. Blair et al. (2001) studied a family with familial hypertrophic cardiomyopathy in which 2 individuals suffered early sudden death and a third individual died suddenly at the age of 60 years with autopsy evidence of familial hypertrophic cardiomyopathy. A val606-to-met (V606M) mutation was observed in the MYH7 gene (160760.0005). This mutation had previously been proposed to give rise to a benign phenotype (see Abchee and Marian, (1997)). A second ala728-to-val (A728V) mutation (160760.0025) was found in cis with the V606M mutation. Blair et al. (2001) suggested that this second mutation in cis explained the more severe phenotype seen in this family. HETEROGENEITY In affected members of an Italian family, Ferraro et al. (1990) found that 7 affected members and none of 3 unaffected members showed a fragile site on 16q (FRA16B). Hengstenberg et al. (1993, 1994) studied a family with familial hypertrophic cardiomyopathy in which preliminary haplotype analyses excluded linkage to chromosomes 14q1, 1q3, 11p13-q13, and 15q2, suggesting the existence of another locus, designated CMH5, for this disorder. Further studies in this family by Richard et al. (1999) demonstrated that of 8 affected family members, 4 had a mutation in the MYH7 gene (160760.0033), 2 had a mutation in the MYBPC3 gene (600958.0014), and 2 were doubly heterozygous for the 2 mutations. The doubly heterozygous patients exhibited marked left ventricular hypertrophy, which was significantly greater than that in the other affected individuals. Seidman and Seidman (2001) reviewed the genetic and clinical heterogeneity of hypertrophic cardiomyopathy. Arad et al. (2002) reviewed the clinical spectrum of hypertrophic cardiomyopathy in the context of genetic heterogeneity, as well as animal models of hypertrophic cardiomyopathy. In 108 consecutive patients with hypertrophic cardiomyopathy diagnosed by echocardiography, angiography, or findings after myectomy, Erdmann et al. (2003) screened for mutations in 6 sarcomeric genes. They identified 34 different mutations: 18 in the MYBPC3 gene in 20 patients, with 2 mutations identified twice; 13 missense mutations in the MYH7 gene in 14 patients, with 1 mutation identified twice; and 1 amino acid change each in the TPM1, TNNT2, and TNNI3 genes. No disease-causing mutation was identified in TNNC1 (191040). In only 8 of the 37 mutation carriers was the mutation sporadic. Thus, systematic mutation screening in a large sample of patients with hypertrophic cardiomyopathy led to a genetic diagnosis in approximately 30% of unrelated index patients and in approximately 57% of patients with a positive family history. PATHOGENESIS Wagner et al. (1989) investigated a possible role of adrenergic innervation or of cellular calcium regulation in pathogenesis, as suggested by the presence of hyperdynamic left ventricular function and by the clinical and symptomatic improvement seen in patients treated with beta-receptor antagonists or calcium antagonists. They found that calcium-antagonist binding sites, measured as the amount of dihydropyridine bound to atrial tissue, were increased by 33% in patients with hypertrophic cardiomyopathy. The densities of saxitoxin-binding sites on voltage-sensitive sodium channels and beta-adrenoceptors did not differ from controls. Wagner et al. (1989) interpreted the findings as suggesting that abnormal calcium fluxes through voltage-sensitive calcium channels may play a pathophysiologic role in the disease. There is evidence that 'myocardial bridging' with compression of an epicardial coronary artery, such as the left anterior descending coronary artery, can cause myocardial ischemia and sudden death. Yetman et al. (1998) performed angiographic studies of 36 children with hypertrophic cardiomyopathy to determine whether myocardial bridging was present and, if so, to assess the characteristics of systolic narrowing of the left anterior descending coronary artery caused by myocardial bridging and the duration of residual diastolic compression. Myocardial bridging was present in 10 (28%) of the patients. As compared with patients without bridging, patients with bridging had a greater incidence of chest pain, cardiac arrest with subsequent resuscitation, and ventricular tachycardia. On average, the patients with bridging had a reduction in systolic blood pressure with exercise, as compared with an elevation in those without bridging. Patients with bridging also had greater ST-segment depression with exercise and a shorter duration of exercise. Kaplan-Meier estimates of the proportions of patients who had not died or had cardiac arrest with subsequent resuscitation 5 years after the diagnosis of hypertrophic cardiomyopathy were 67% among patients with bridging and 94% among those without bridging. No statement concerning the family history or other information relevant to a etiology in these patients was provided. Using pharmacologic models of cardiac hypertrophy in mice, Friddle et al. (2000) performed expression profiling with fragments of more than 4,000 genes to characterize and contrast expression changes during induction and regression of hypertrophy. Administration of angiotensin II and isoproterenol by osmotic minipump produced increases in cardiac weight (15% and 45%, respectively) that returned to preinduction size after drug withdrawal. From multiple expression analyses of left ventricular RNA isolated at daily time points during cardiac hypertrophy and regression, Friddle et al. (2000) identified sets of genes whose expression was altered at specific stages of this process. While confirming the participation of 25 genes or pathways previously shown to be altered by hypertrophy, a larger set of 30 genes was identified whose expression had not previously been associated with cardiac hypertrophy or regression. Of the 55 genes that showed reproducible changes during the time course of induction and regression, 32 were altered only during induction, and 8 were altered only during regression. Thus, cardiac remodeling during regression uses a set of genes that are distinct from those used during induction of hypertrophy. Tsybouleva et al. (2004) observed that myocardial aldosterone and aldosterone synthase (CYP11B2; 124080) mRNA levels were elevated by 4- to 6-fold in patients with hypertrophic cardiomyopathy compared to controls. In studies in rat cardiomyocytes, they found that aldosterone increased expression of several hypertrophic markers via protein kinase D (PRKCM; 605435) and increased collagens and TGFB1 (190180) via PI3K-delta (PIK3CD; 602839). Inhibition of PRKCM and PIK3CD abrogated the hypertrophic and profibrotic effects, respectively, as did the mineralcorticoid receptor antagonist spironolactone. In a mouse model of hypertrophic cardiomyopathy, spironolactone reversed interstitial fibrosis, decreased myocyte disarray, and improved diastolic function. Tsybouleva et al. (2004) concluded that aldosterone is a major link between sarcomeric mutations and cardiac phenotype in CMH. CLINICAL MANAGEMENT Wilson et al. (1983) observed marked improvement in the manifestations of familial hypertrophic cardiomyopathy when affected persons with hyperthyroidism were treated for the latter condition. This prompted them to suggest that antithyroid therapy 'should be considered in this form of cardiomyopathy.' In discussing the management of hypertrophic cardiomyopathy, Spirito et al. (1997) reviewed heterogeneity of clinical and genetic features and stated that 'the diverse clinical and genetic features of hypertrophic cardiomyopathy make it impossible to define precise guidelines for management.' The treatment of symptoms to improve quality of life and the identification of patients who are at high risk for sudden death and require aggressive therapy are 2 distinct issues that must be addressed by largely independent strategies. The stratification of risk and the prevention of sudden death were discussed. Ventricular tachycardia or fibrillation is thought to be the principal mechanism of sudden death in patients with hypertrophic cardiomyopathy. Maron et al. (2000) conducted a retrospective study, the results of which indicated that in high-risk patients with hypertrophic cardiomyopathy, implantable defibrillators are highly effective in terminating such arrhythmias, indicating that these devices have a role in the prevention of sudden death. In comments on the study of Maron et al. (2000), Watkins (2000) stated that for most patients with hypertrophic cardiomyopathy, the risk is not high enough to offset the adverse effects of an implantable defibrillator. He suggested the creation of an international registry to document discharge rates after implantation for each of the indicators of risk. Ideally, the data should include molecular genetic information, since the underlying mutation will itself be predictive. He cited the cohort studies of McKenna et al. (1985) in which patients with hypertrophic cardiomyopathy who were treated with low-dose amiodarone compared with untreated historical controls suggested that long-term treatment was partially protective; and the work of Ostman-Smith et al. (1999), indicating that high doses of beta-blockers may also confer protection. Since there has been an excess rate of sudden death during or shortly after exercise, most physicians recommend that patients with hypertrophic cardiomyopathy avoid competitive sports or intensive exertion. In a study of 480 consecutive patients with hypertrophic cardiomyopathy, Spirito et al. (2000) found that the magnitude of hypertrophy is directly related to the risk of sudden death and then is a strong and independent predictor of prognosis. Young patients with extreme hypertrophy, even those with few or no symptoms, appeared to be at substantial long-term risk and thus were considered for interventions to prevent sudden death. Most patients with mild hypertrophy were at low risk and were reassured regarding their prognosis. Ho et al. (2002) studied confirmed MYH7 mutation heterozygotes using echocardiography, including Doppler tissue imaging. Left ventricular ejection fraction was significantly higher in mutation carriers than in normal controls. Mean early diastolic myocardial velocities were significantly lower in mutation carriers, irrespective of whether hypertrophy was already present. Overall the authors concluded that abnormalities of diastolic function were detectable before the onset of myocardial hypertrophy in mutation carriers, providing a mechanism for predicting affected individuals. POPULATION GENETICS In a discussion of hypertrophic cardiomyopathy, Maron et al. (1987) stated that approximately 45% of cases are sporadic. New mutations cannot be the explanation for all of the sporadic cases; hence, there may be other etiologically distinct disorders represented in the group of hypertrophic cardiomyopathies. Systematic echocardiographic surveys of families of patients with hypertrophic cardiomyopathy have identified relatives older than 50 years of age with mild and localized left ventricular hypertrophy. Thus, the true proportion of sporadic cases may not be as high as 45%.

comment: A number sign (#) is used with the entry because Waardenburg syndrome type I is caused by mutation in the PAX3 gene (606597). DESCRIPTION The features of Waardenburg syndrome are wide bridge of the nose owing to lateral displacement of the inner canthus of each eye, pigmentary disturbance (frontal white blaze of hair, heterochromia iridis, white eye lashes, leukoderma), and cochlear deafness. The severity varies widely and some affected persons escape deafness. NOMENCLATURE WS type I (WS1) is distinguished from WS type II (WS2) by the presence in WS1 of dystopia canthorum, a lateral displacement of the inner canthi. Klein's name is sometimes combined with Waardenburg's in the eponymic designation of this disorder, on the basis of a patient that Klein (1950) described with 'partial albinism,' blue eyes, deaf-mutism, undeveloped muscles and fused joints in the arms, skeletal dysplasia, etc. See 148820 for evidence that the Klein-Waardenburg syndrome, also known as Waardenburg syndrome type III, is due to an allelic mutation in the PAX3 gene or is a contiguous gene syndrome due to deletion of the PAX3 gene and adjacent genes. CLINICAL FEATURES Yoshino et al. (1986) evaluated the incidence of dystopia canthorum in a 3-generation family with Waardenburg syndrome and concluded that it is the most frequently expressed sign of the condition. Laestadius et al. (1969) provided normal standards for the measurement of inner canthal and outer canthal distance. Standards were also presented by Christian et al. (1969). Lateral displacement of the inner canthi is seen also in the oral-facial-digital syndrome type I (311200). Skipped generations and the occurrence of bilateral cleft lip were documented by Giacoia and Klein (1969) Winship and Beighton (1992) reviewed phenotypic variation on the basis of an analysis of 68 affected children. In a craniofacial anthropometric study of 51 WS type I individuals, da-Silva et al. (1993) concluded that the most discriminating parameters were, from clinical measurements, intercanthal distance (which was increased) and philtrum length (which was decreased) and, from roentgenographic measurements, nasal bone length (which was decreased) and lower facial height (which was increased). In place of the measurement of inner canthal distance, the Waardenburg Consortium (Farrer et al., 1992) recommended the W index: a composite measure including the inner canthal, inner pupillary, and outer canthal distances. Normal and dystopic subjects had W values (mean +/- S.D.) of 1.76 +/- 0.16 and 2.61 +/- 0.19, respectively (Newton, 1989); the Waardenburg Consortium recommended a threshold W value of 2.07. Individual I-2 had a W index of 2.21 but was the only member of the family with a value over 2.07. See 193510 for further discussion of type II Waardenburg syndrome which in some families is not linked to PAX3. The disorder has been described in American blacks (Hansen et al., 1965) and in Maoris (Houghton, 1964) as well as in Europeans. Cleft palate and/or lip occurs in some cases. Premature graying of the hair is an effect of the gene. The fundus may be completely or partially albinotic and depigmented areas of skin like those of piebald trait (172800) may be present. In the state of South Australia, the Waardenburg syndrome is a leading cause of deafness and 'enjoys' a position comparable to porphyria in South Africa, having been introduced by early settlers who have many descendants (Fraser, 1967). The white forelock may be present at birth and later disappear (Feingold et al., 1967). Arias (1971) observed black forelock in place of white forelock. An affected Chinese family was reported by Chew et al. (1968). Goodman et al. (1988) observed absence of vagina and of right-sided uterine adnexa in an 18-year-old woman with WS1. They postulated that these are related to Waardenburg syndrome because of altered invasion of neurons in early embryogenesis. The occurrence of Hirschsprung disease (aganglionic megacolon; 142623) in patients with the Waardenburg syndrome is noteworthy (McKusick, 1973; Lowry, 1975; Omenn and McKusick, 1979). Fraser (1976) described a deaf male with no family history of deafness, complete blue-green heterochromia with hypoplastic stroma in the blue iris, and Hirschsprung disease. Chatkupt et al. (1993) stated that spina bifida had been noted in at least 4 patients with Waardenburg syndrome. Chatkupt et al. (1993) reported the cases of brothers with both Waardenburg syndrome and lumbosacral myelomeningocele. The mother had features of Waardenburg syndrome. Spina bifida occurs with the 'Splotch' mutation, which molecular studies indicate is the homologous disorder in the mouse. Read and Newton (1997) provided a review of the clinical features and molecular basis of Waardenburg syndrome and other auditory pigmentary syndromes. Pardono et al. (2003) studied 59 patients with Waardenburg syndrome from 37 families (30 with type I, 21 with type II, and 8 isolated individuals without telecanthus). All patients were examined for the presence of 8 cardinal diagnostic signs: telecanthus, synophrys, iris pigmentation disturbances, partial hair albinism, hearing impairment, hypopigmented skin spots, nasal root hyperplasia, and lower lachrimal dystopia. Using their own data as well as those collected from the literature, the authors estimated the frequencies of the cardinal signs of Waardenburg syndrome based on a sample of 461 affected individuals with type I and 121 with type II. INHERITANCE Jones et al. (1975) found evidence of paternal age effect in new mutations for this autosomal dominant disorder. Kapur and Karam (1991) described a family in which 3 children with this disorder were born to normal, unrelated parents. Germline mosaicism was postulated. According to the report of Zlotogora et al. (1995), the homozygous form of Waardenburg syndrome is a very severe disorder that has been called WS type III (148820). In a large kindred, including many individuals affected with Waardenburg syndrome type I, they found a child with a very severe form of type III. The child presented with dystopia canthorum, partial albinism, and very severe upper-limb defects. His parents were first cousins, and both were affected with a mild form of WS1. Molecular analysis showed homozygosity for a point mutation in the PAX3 gene (606597.0009). Since all homozygous PAX3 mutations in mice lead to severe neural tube defects and intrauterine or neonatal death, the survival of the homozygote in this case and the absence of neural tube defects were unexpected. Ayme and Philip (1995) indeed observed exencephaly in a fetus with possible homozygous Waardenburg syndrome. The fetus was the product of a mating between a gypsy brother and sister, both of whom had Waardenburg syndrome. As noted later, dystopia canthorum, as measured by the W-index, is one of the key diagnostic features of WS1. Reynolds et al. (1996) sought to determine whether the W-index is influenced primarily by allelic variation in the PAX3 disease gene or other major loci, by polygenic background effects, or by all of these potential sources of genetic variation. They studied both WS1-affected individuals and their WS1 unaffected relatives. After adjustment of the W-index for WS1 disease status, segregation analyses by the regression approach indicated major-locus control of this variation, although residual parent-offspring and sib-sib correlations were consistent with additional (possibly polygenic) affects. Separate analyses of WS1-affected and WS1-unaffected individuals suggested that epistatic interactions between disease alleles at the PAX3 WS1 locus and a second major locus influenced variation in dystopia canthorum. Reynolds et al. (1996) suggested that their approach should be applicable for assessing the 'genetic architecture' of variation associated with other genetic diseases. While mutations in PAX3 seem to be responsible for most, if not all, WS1 cases, it is not clear what accounts for the reduced penetrance of deafness. Stochastic events during development may be the factors that determine whether a person with a PAX3 mutation will be congenitally deaf or not. Alternatively, genetic background, nonrandom environmental factors, or both may be significant. Morell et al. (1997) compared the likelihood for deafness in affected subjects from 24 families with PAX3 mutations and in 7 of the families originally described by Waardenburg. They found evidence that stochastic variation alone does not explain the differences in penetrance of deafness among WS families. Their analyses suggested that genetic background in combination with certain PAX3 alleles may be important factors in the etiology of deafness in WS1. MAPPING Simpson et al. (1974) and Arias et al. (1975) found a weak suggestion of linkage to the ABO locus, known to be located in 9q34. Read et al. (1989) excluded linkage to ABO. In a study of 2 large kindreds in northeastern Brazil, da-Silva et al. (1990) could not confirm linkage to ABO. Other studies of the same 2 Brazilian kindreds were reported by da-Silva (1991). Since a plausible mouse model is 'Steel' (Sl), a dominant mutation on mouse chromosome 10 closely linked to Pep-2, Read et al. (1989) studied polymorphic probes for loci on human chromosome 12 close to PEPB, the human homolog, in 7 families. They excluded a sizable region of 12q as the site of this gene. Ishikiriyama et al. (1989) reported the case of a 20-month-old boy with dystopia canthorum, sensorineural deafness, heterochromia iridis, partially albinotic ocular fundi, and partial leukoderma. Cytogenetic studies showed a paracentric inversion (2)(q35q37.3); his parents had normal chromosomes. Ishikiriyama et al. (1989) suggested that the gene for Waardenburg syndrome type I may be located at 2q35 or 2q37.3. Kirkpatrick et al. (1992) described WS type I in a child with del(2)(q35q36.2). Because of this report and that of Lin et al. (1992) of deletion of 2q37 without features of WS1, Ishikiriyama (1993) concluded that the WS1 gene is located at 2q35. On the basis of an analysis of mouse and hamster mutants as models for Waardenburg syndrome(s), Asher and Friedman (1990) predicted that the gene(s) would be found to be on chromosome 2q near fibronectin-1, on chromosome 3p near the protooncogene RAF1 or 3q near rhodopsin, or on chromosome 4p near the protooncogene KIT. Foy et al. (1990) demonstrated linkage of the Waardenburg syndrome to placental alkaline phosphatase (ALPP; 171800), which had previously been assigned to 2q37; the peak lod score was 4.76 at a recombination fraction of 0.023. These findings suggest that the distal breakpoint responsible for the paracentric inversion is at the site of the Waardenburg syndrome, namely, 2q37.3. This region of chromosome 2 is homologous to mouse chromosome 1, which contains the 'Splotch' locus (Sp). This patchy pigment mutation is accompanied by a malformation of the inner ear and severe CNS malformation in the homozygote. Whether the heterozygote is deaf is unclear. By PCR analysis of somatic cell hybrids, Pilz et al. (1993) mapped the PAX3 gene to chromosome 2. Quoting William Harvey's famous observation that 'Nature is nowhere accustomed more openly to display her secret mysteries than in cases where she shows traces of her workings apart from the beaten path,' Duyk et al. (1992) reviewed the forms of deafness, syndromal and nonsyndromal, for which linkage has been established. Work in the hamster model for Waardenburg syndrome suggested to Asher and Friedman (1990) that modifier genes may account for the intrafamilial variation in phenotype in Waardenburg syndrome. In a family with 11 affected individuals spanning 4 generations, Asher et al. (1991) confirmed the assignment of WS1 to 2q. No recombination was found with ALPP at 2q37 or with FN1 (135600) at 2q34-q36. In a report from a consortium, Grundfast et al. (1991) concluded that only about 56% of WS families are linked to 2q markers. Furthermore, in the families with apparent linkage, they found no obligatory crossovers between WS1 and ALPP. For the whole collection of families, they obtained a maximum lod of 12.5 at theta = 0.31 for the WS1/ALPP linkage. Farrer et al. (1992) estimated that the WS1 gene on chromosome 2 was responsible for approximately 45% of the 44 families in their sample. Wilcox et al. (1992) used the intron between exons 2 and 3, amplified by PCR, as a probe to determine that the PAX3 gene is located on chromosome 2, from the study of DNA from somatic cell hybrids. They also identified a highly informative CA dinucleotide repeat. Farrer et al. (1994) found that all families with WS1 showed linkage to the PAX3 region of chromosome 2. Three forms of WS2 (defined as absence of dystopia canthorum, i.e., W index less than 2.07) have been defined on the basis of linkage studies: WS2A (193510) due to mutation in the MITF gene (156845) maps to 3p; WS2B (600193) maps to 1p; and WS2C (606662) maps to 8p. GENOTYPE/PHENOTYPE CORRELATIONS In a series of patients with Waardenburg syndrome, Tassabehji et al. (1994) found a number of previously unidentified PAX3 mutations. These included a chromosomal deletion, a splice site mutation, and an amino acid substitution that closely corresponded to the molecular changes seen in the 'Splotch-retarded' and 'Splotch-delayed' mouse mutants, respectively. These mutations confirmed that Waardenburg syndrome is produced by gene dosage effects and showed that the phenotypic differences between 'Splotch' mice and humans with Waardenburg syndrome are caused by differences in genetic background rather than different primary effects of the mutations. Chalepakis et al. (1994) studied the functional consequence of the mutations described in 606597.0001 and 606597.0006 on DNA binding and compared the results with those in the 'Splotch' mouse. Combining the phenotypic features of heterozygous mutants and considering that molecular defects ranging from single point mutations to large deletions cause similar phenotypes, they excluded the possibility that the mutated allele in heterozygotes interferes with the function of the wildtype allele. Contrariwise, they considered both WS and 'Splotch' mutants to represent loss-of-function mutations. Baldwin et al. (1995) stated that their analysis of a total of 30 PAX3 mutations causing WS type I or type III demonstrated little correlation between genotype and phenotype. Deletions of the entire PAX3 gene resulted in phenotypes indistinguishable from those associated with single-base substitutions in the paired domain or homeodomain of the gene. Moreover, 2 similar mutations in close proximity could result in significantly different phenotypes, WS type I in 1 family and WS type III in another. DeStefano et al. (1998) assessed the relationship between phenotype and gene defect in 48 families containing 271 individuals with WS collected by members of the Waardenburg Consortium. They grouped the 42 unique mutations previously identified in the PAX3 gene in these families into 5 mutation categories: amino acid substitution in the paired domain, amino acid substitution in the homeodomain, deletion of the ser-thr-pro-rich region, deletion of the homeodomain and the ser-thr-pro-rich region, and deletion of the entire gene. This classification of mutations was based on the structure of the PAX3 gene and was chosen to group mutations predicted to have similar defects in the gene product. They found that odds for the presence of eye pigment abnormality, white forelock, and skin hypopigmentation were 2, 8, and 5 times greater, respectively, for individuals with deletions of the homeodomain and the pro-ser-thr-rich region compared to individuals with an amino acid substitution in the homeodomain. Odds ratios that differed significantly from 1.0 for these traits may indicate that the gene products resulting from different classes of mutations act differently in the expression of WS. Although a suggestive association was detected for hearing loss with an odds ratio of 2.6 for amino acid substitution in the paired domain compared with amino acid substitution in the homeodomain, this odds ratio did not differ significantly from 1.0. PATHOGENESIS Mutations in MITF (156845) and PAX3, encoding transcriptions factors, are responsible for Waardenburg syndrome type II (193510) and WS1/WS3, respectively. Tachibana et al. (1996) showed that MITF transactivates the gene for tyrosinase (see 606933), a key enzyme for melanogenesis, and is critically involved in melanocyte differentiation. Absence of melanocytes affects pigmentation in the skin, hair, and eyes, and hearing function in the cochlea. Therefore, hypopigmentation and hearing loss in WS2 are likely to be the results of an anomaly of melanocyte differentiation caused by MITF mutations. Watanabe et al. (1998) showed that PAX3 transactivates the MITF promoter. They further showed that PAX3 proteins associated with WS1 in either the paired domain or the homeodomain failed the recognize and transactivate the MITF promoter. These results provided evidence that PAX3 directly regulates MITF, and suggested that the failure of this regulation due to PAX3 mutations causes the auditory-pigmentary symptoms in at least some individuals with WS1. Bondurand et al. (2000) showed that SOX10 (602229), in synergy with PAX3, strongly activates MITF expression in transfection assays. Transfection experiments revealed that PAX3 and SOX10 interact directly by binding to a proximal region of the MITF promoter containing binding sites for both factors. Mutant SOX10 or PAX3 proteins failed to transactivate this promoter, providing further evidence that the 2 genes act in concert to directly regulate expression of MITF. In situ hybridization experiments carried out in the dominant megacolon (Dom) mouse confirmed that SOX10 dysfunction impaired Mitf expression as well as melanocytic development and survival. The authors hypothesized that interaction between 3 of the genes that are altered in WS could explain the auditory/pigmentary symptoms of this disease.

comment: A number sign (#) is used with this entry because heterozygous mutations in the SOX2 gene (184429) can cause the abnormality. CLINICAL FEATURES This anomaly is due to failure of formation of the optic pit. Only the ectodermal elements are missing. It is always bilateral. In almost all instances the parents are related. For example, Cecchetto (1920) reported a pedigree in which 2 brothers, each married to a first cousin, had a child with bilateral anophthalmos. The common grandparents were also first cousins. Hesselberg (1951) reported affected children from first-cousin parents. Sorsby (1934) discovered early reports of affected sibs with normal parents. Ashley (1947) reported an affected Japanese brother and sister. Sometimes differentiation of extreme microphthalmos (251600) and of cryptophthalmos (219000) from anophthalmos is difficult. Ragge et al. (2005) described the clinical features of 5 patients reported by Fantes et al. (2003) and 4 additional patients with bilateral anophthalmia/microphthalmia. Extraocular features included mild facial dysmorphism, seizure disorder, global developmental delay, mesial temporal brain malformations, disordered muscle tone with evidence of mild basal ganglia dysfunction, growth failure, and male genital tract abnormalities. The authors noted that the neurologic features were relatively consistent but highly variable in severity. MOLECULAR GENETICS Fantes et al. (2003) found a microdeletion involving the SOX2 gene in a patient with bilateral anophthalmia and by subsequent SOX2 mutation analysis identified heterozygous de novo truncating mutations in 4 of 35 (11%) individuals with anophthalmia (184429.0001-184429.0003). Both eyes were affected in all cases with an identified mutation. In 4 patients with bilateral anophthalmia/microphthalmia, Ragge et al. (2005) identified heterozygous de novo mutations in the SOX2 gene, including a missense mutation (184429.0004) and 3 frameshift mutations. In a 12-year-old girl with bilateral clinical anophthalmia and aplasia of the optic nerve, chiasm, and optic tracts, Hagstrom et al. (2005) identified heterozygosity for a de novo nonsense mutation in the SOX2 gene (184429.0005). The patient also had mild bilateral sensorineural hearing loss and global developmental delay.

comment: Cumming et al. (1986) described a stillborn male infant, born at 27 weeks' gestation of an Egyptian couple related as first cousins once removed, who had bowed limbs, marked cervical lymphocele (a term the authors preferred to cystic hygroma), polycystic dysplasia of the kidneys, pancreas, and liver, short gut, and polysplenia. Two apparently identically affected stillborn infants, a male and a female, had been born previously at 28 weeks' gestation. Urioste et al. (1991) described 2 female sibs, the offspring of healthy nonconsanguineous parents, who died shortly after birth. They showed generalized lymphedema, cervical lymphocele, shortness of limbs, bowed long bones, and multicystic kidneys with fibrotic liver or pancreas. Ming et al. (1997) described a fetus with tetramelic campomelia, polysplenia, multicystic dysplastic kidneys, and cervical lymphocele. In addition, there were anomalies not previously described in this condition, including abnormal lung lobation with bilateral left bronchial morphology, dextrocardia, total anomalous pulmonary venous return, left superior vena cava, and right aortic arch. The pancreas was short, with absence of the body and tail. Ming et al. (1997) suggested that the syndrome reported by Cumming et al. (1986) could be expanded to include polysplenia with heterotaxia and that Cumming syndrome may be considered another autosomal recessive condition associated with a laterality defect. Perez del Rio et al. (1999) reported the cases of 2 sisters born to young parents of unknown consanguinity. The clinical and autopsy findings were considered to be consistent with the diagnosis of Cumming syndrome. The first fetus was stillborn at 36 weeks and showed hydrops, cloverleaf skull, and a severely deformed face, with a considerable amount of redundant subcutaneous tissue, massive cervical edema, and microphthalmos. The facial appearance was said to be similar to that of a 40-day embryo. The chest was narrow and the abdomen swollen with mild ascites. All 4 limbs were short and bowed. Autopsy revealed lung hypoplasia, enlarged cystic kidneys, and hepatomegaly. The second fetus, delivered by cesarean section at 31 weeks, died within minutes after delivery. The external appearance was similar to that of her sister, with cloverleaf skull and redundant soft tissue in the occipital and facial regions. Again, lung hypoplasia and enlarged cystic kidneys were found. The liver likewise showed polycystic dysplasia. Watiker et al. (2005) reported 2 patients originally diagnosed as having Cumming syndrome who were subsequently found to have mutations in the SOX9 gene, prompting reassessment of the cases and reclassification as campomelic dysplasia (114290). Features consistent with Cumming syndrome included campomelia of prenatal onset, cystic hygroma, and a small chest; 1 patient also had a cleft palate and multicystic kidneys, and the other had a complex congenital heart defect. The patients also had short, irregular chondrocyte columns, whereas chondroosseous morphology appears normal in campomelic dysplasia except at the diaphyseal bend. Watiker et al. (2005) concluded that the presence of a narrow, tall pelvis, hypoplastic scapulae, and sex reversal are key findings in campomelic dysplasia that allow it to be differentiated from Cumming syndrome.

comment: A number sign (#) is used with this entry because of evidence that most affected individuals with CHARGE syndrome have mutations involving the chromodomain helicase DNA-binding protein-7 (CHD7; 608892). The phenotype can also be caused by mutation in the semaphorin-3E gene (SEMA3E; 608166). CLINICAL FEATURES Choanal atresia (see 608911) is a feature of the CHARGE association: coloboma of the eye; heart anomaly; atresia, choanal; retardation of mental and somatic development; microphallus; ear abnormalities and/or deafness (Pagon et al., 1981). Facial palsy, cleft palate, and dysphagia are commonly associated. The first descriptions of this syndrome were provided by Hall (1979) and Hittner et al. (1979). Hall (1979) reported a constellation of nonrandomly associated malformations occurring with choanal atresia. Hittner et al. (1979) reported 10 individuals, including a mother and child, with colobomatous microphthalmia, heart disease, abnormalities of the external ear with associated hearing loss, and mental retardation. They noted that multiple other anomalies may be associated. Koletzko and Majewski (1984) described 6 patients with choanal atresia and additional malformations and reviewed 11 previously reported cases. Their findings validated the CHARGE association but suggested the inclusion of orofacial clefts and esophageal atresia as main features. A certain degree of dysmorphism (low-set and dysplastic ears, retrogenia, antimongoloid slant of palpebral fissures, anteverted nares) was observed in each of their 6 patients. Infants with bilateral choanal atresia plus cardiac defects and those with choanal atresia plus renal malformations had a high mortality rate. Recurrence risk is low. Davenport et al. (1986) described 15 cases, 9 sporadic and 6 familial. They concluded that CHARGE is a recognizable pattern of malformations and a true syndrome rather than an association. They pointed to external ear malformations (see their photographs) and a 'wedge-shaped' audiogram that may be unique features valuable in diagnosis. Mixed conductive and sensorineural deafness causes an audiogram with a descending bone conduction curve intersecting at low frequencies with a flat curve for air conduction. Congenital facial paralysis occurs in few other conditions. Feeding difficulties are striking even in the absence of cleft palate or tracheoesophageal fistula. Metlay et al. (1987) reported a patient with CHARGE syndrome as manifested by coloboma of the optic nerve head, congenital heart defect (ASD, VSD, and parachute mitral valve), choanal atresia, severe growth retardation, genital hypoplasia, abnormal ears, cleft lip and palate, and pectus carinatum. He died at 19 months of age. His mother was short and had hearing impairment, choanal atresia, and a coloboma of the left iris. Reported familial cases were tabulated. Tetralogy of Fallot is the most frequent type of heart defect reported in the CHARGE association (Cyran et al., 1987). Ivarsson et al. (1988) reported supravalvular and peripheral pulmonary stenosis in a patient with CHARGE association who also had an atrial septal defect. Oley et al. (1988) described 14 boys and 6 girls, including monozygotic twins, who all had at least 4 of the 7 major features included in the mnemonic CHARGE. All had ear anomalies or deafness or both and either coloboma or choanal atresia or both. All the boys had evidence of hypogonadism. Many had a characteristic facial appearance: unusually shaped ears, unilateral facial palsy, square face, malar flattening, and pinched nostrils. All were sporadic cases. Hurst et al. (1989) reported a brother and sister who had atrial septal defect and ventricular septal defect, short stature, microcephaly, developmental delay, and similar dysmorphic facial appearance. The boy had bilateral choanal hypoplasia and stenosis, and Hurst et al. (1989) suspected that the girl had mild choanal stenosis because she had problems in feeding and sucking in the first few months of life. Bialer and Brown (1990) argued that the diagnosis was indeed the CHARGE association in the case of the sibs reported by Hurst et al. (1989). Meinecke et al. (1989) described the rare association of cutaneous syndactyly and nail hypoplasia with the more frequent features of the CHARGE syndrome. Blake et al. (1990) reviewed the clinical experience of 50 patients with CHARGE syndrome. Lin et al. (1990) reviewed 136 patients from the literature and added 8 more. In 47 of these, either a postmortem examination or a computerized axial tomography of the head had been performed. Of the 47, 26 (55%) had definite central nervous system malformations, predominantly forebrain anomalies, particularly arhinencephaly and holoprosencephaly. The presence of CNS malformation was most strongly associated with choanal atresia. Tellier et al. (1996) found a significant increase in mean paternal age at birth of 41 CHARGE patients (33.7 +/- 8 years) as compared with the control population (30.8 +/- 5 years), suggesting the possible role of a dominant mutation or a subtle chromosomal abnormality. Maternal age was not significantly different in patients and controls. Van Meter and Weaver (1996) reported 2 infants (a male and a female) with significant overlap of symptoms of CHARGE association and Goldenhar anomaly (164210). In addition, both infants had plagiocephaly and torticollis, and the boy had cleft lip, heminostril, and tracheoesophageal fistula. The authors suggested that deficiency in migration of neural crest cells, deficiency of mesodermal formation, or defective interaction between neural crest cells and mesoderm may explain the pathogenesis of these defects of blastogenesis. Tellier et al. (1998) evaluated 47 CHARGE patients for the frequency of major anomalies, namely, coloboma (79%), heart malformation (85%), choanal atresia (57%), growth and/or mental retardation (100%), genital anomalies (34%), ear anomalies (91%), and/or deafness (62%). In addition, they commented on anomalies observed frequently in neonates and infants with the CHARGE syndrome, including minor facial anomalies, neonatal brainstem dysfunction with cranial nerve palsy, and internal ear anomalies such as semicircular canal hypoplasia, which was found in each patient that could be tested. Criteria for poor survival were thought to include male gender, central nervous system and/or esophageal malformations, and bilateral choanal atresia. A significantly higher mean paternal age at conception together with concordance in monozygotic twins and the existence of rare familial cases supported the role of genetic factors such as de novo dominant mutation or subtle submicroscopic chromosome rearrangement. The G of the CHARGE association represents genital hypoplasia, which is typically recognized only in males (micropenis/cryptorchidism). On the basis of 9 individuals with CHARGE association, Wheeler et al. (2000) identified hypogonadotropic hypogonadism, manifested by hypogenitalism and gonadotropins at or below minimal detectable levels at ages when these hormones should be readily measurable. The authors suggested that central hypogonadism is responsible not only for the genital hypoplasia in male patients but also for the lack of secondary sexual development in patients of both sexes. Measurement of serum luteinizing hormone (see 152780) and follicle-stimulating hormone (see 136530) in infants may help establish the diagnosis; these determinations in teenagers with CHARGE association can result in early diagnosis of hypogonadotropic hypogonadism, allowing for treatment of hormonal deficiencies and minimization of potential secondary psychosocial and medical problems. POPULATION GENETICS With an estimated birth incidence of 1 in 12,000, CHARGE syndrome is a common cause of congenital anomalies (Kallen et al., 1999). DIAGNOSIS An analysis by Harris et al. (1997) of choanal atresia-associated malformations, present in 47% of the infants studied without chromosome anomalies, indicated that a weak, nonrandom association can be demonstrated between the malformations of the CHARGE complex. If the definition of CHARGE is the presence of 3 or more malformations, then of the 444 infants identified, 7% belonged to the CHARGE constellation. Harris et al. (1997) concluded that for the term CHARGE to be meaningful, it should be restricted to infants with multiple malformations and choanal atresia and/or coloboma, combined with other cardinal malformations (heart, ear, and genital), for a total of at least 3 cardinal malformations; growth retardation, especially low birth weight, should not be used in the definition. CYTOGENETICS Kushnick et al. (1992) reported an infant girl with the findings of CHARGE association, a 46,XY karyotype, and absence of gonads. Absence of ZFY by DNA probe was also found. Emanuel et al. (1992) found evidence of microdeletion in the 22q11.2 region in 1 of 18 patients with the CHARGE syndrome. This contrasted with microdeletion in 14 of 15 cases of velocardiofacial syndrome (192430) and in 4 of 9 patients with isolated conotruncal cardiac malformations (217095). Devriendt et al. (1998) described the case of a female child with features of the CHARGE association, including iris coloboma, large ventricular septal defect, external ear abnormalities, severe growth retardation, and moderate mental delay, associated with a submicroscopic deletion in 22q11 detected by means of fluorescence in situ hybridization. Since there were features of the velocardiofacial syndrome and cat-eye syndrome, the presence of a more complex rearrangement of 22q, with a deletion duplication, was suspected. North et al. (1995) described a 4.5-year-old girl with CHARGE association who had a de novo inverted duplication (14)(q22-q24.3). Clinical features included iris colobomas, ventricular septal defect, soft tissue choanal atresia, intellectual impairment, growth retardation, sensorineural deafness, apparently low-set ears, and upslanting palpebral fissures. Family history was unremarkable and parental chromosomes were normal. North et al. (1995) compared the findings in their case with those in 5 reported cases of 14q duplication. Although none of the other cases had choanal atresia, the other findings were such as to suggest that a gene or genes causing some of the anomalies of CHARGE association may reside in the region 14q22-q24.3. Hurst et al. (1991) reported a girl with CHARGE syndrome and an apparently balanced chromosome 8 translocation. She had bilateral retinal coloboma, tetralogy of Fallot, unilateral choanal atresia, abnormalities of the external ears, bilateral sensorineural deafness, unilateral facial nerve palsy, and tracheoesophageal fistula. Parental karyotypes were normal. INHERITANCE Lalani et al. (2006) presented 5 pedigrees with CHARGE syndrome illustrating 4 familial cases and an affected pair of monozygotic twins. CHD7 mutations were identified in a family with affected brother and sister, in the monozygotic twins, and in a family with mildly affected mother and daughter. In the case of the affected brother and sister, parental gonadal mosaicism was suspected. MOLECULAR GENETICS Since PAX2 (167409) gene expression occurs in primordia affected in CHARGE association, Tellier et al. (2000) analyzed the PAX2 gene in 34 patients fulfilling diagnostic criteria for CHARGE. The authors used 2 polymorphisms to look for deletions, and SSCP of the 12 exons to look for nucleotide variations. No disease-causing mutations were identified, suggesting that mutation of the PAX2 gene is not a common cause of CHARGE association. The authors suggested that the expression pattern of PAX2 is consistent with the possibility that unidentified PAX2 downstream targets and effectors could be candidate genes for CHARGE. Using an improved method of array comparative genomic hybridization (CGH), Vissers et al. (2004) reported a 2.3-Mb de novo overlapping microdeletion on chromosome 8q12 in 2 individuals with CHARGE syndrome. Sequence analysis of genes located in this region detected mutations in CHD7 (608892) in 10 of 17 individuals with CHARGE syndrome who did not have microdeletions, thus accounting for the disease in most affected persons. An individual with CHARGE syndrome with an apparently balanced chromosome 8 translocation had been reported by Hurst et al. (1991). In a patient originally described by Martin et al. (2001) with CHARGE syndrome and a de novo balanced translocation involving chromosomes 2 and 7, Lalani et al. (2004) mapped the translocation breakpoints and identified the semaphorin-3E gene within 200 kb of the breakpoint on 7q21.11. Screening of patients with CHARGE syndrome for mutations in the SEMA3E gene revealed a de novo mutation in an unrelated patient (S703L; 608166.0001). The mutation was not found in either parent or in 338 ethnically matched control chromosomes. Lalani et al. (2006) sequenced the CHD7 gene in 110 individuals who had received a clinical diagnosis of CHARGE syndrome, and detected mutations in 64 (58%). Phenotypically, the mutation-positive group was more likely to exhibit cardiovascular malformations, coloboma of the eye, and facial asymmetry, often caused by seventh cranial nerve abnormalities. Microarray gene expression analysis showed a signature pattern of gene expression differences that distinguished the individuals with CHARGE syndrome with CHD7 mutations from controls. HISTORY The syndrome reported by Abruzzo and Erickson (1977), and cited as an instance of familial CHARGE syndrome by Davenport et al. (1986) and Metlay et al. (1987), was demonstrated by Abruzzo and Erickson (1989) to be a separate, probably X-linked disorder (302905).

comment: A number sign (#) is used with this entry because Gaucher disease type III is caused by mutation in the gene encoding acid beta-glucosidase (GBA; 606463). Mutation in the same gene causes Gaucher disease type I (230800) and type II (230900). The clinical features of type III Gaucher disease, apart from those referable to the nervous system, are common to the other types. Hepatosplenomegaly usually precedes neurologic abnormality. The variability in organ involvement is similar to that seen in type I. The age of onset is also variable. The Swedish group of cases (Norrbottnian Gaucher disease) is the largest (see later). Neurologic abnormalities include ataxia, spastic paraplegia, grand mal and/or psychomotor seizures, supranuclear ophthalmoplegia, and dementia. Supranuclear gaze palsies (ocular motor apraxia; 257550) are characteristic of type III Gaucher disease (Erikson and Wahlberg, 1985; Gross-Tsur et al., 1989). Miller et al. (1973) described a black family in which 3 sibs had enzymatically proved Gaucher disease and neurologic manifestations including seizures. As noted by Dreborg et al. (1980), 'the rough grouping of the many published cases into 3 main types, I, II, and III, must be considered more as a facilitation for working purposes than as a biologically based classification.' They reported clinical studies of a large number of cases of a distinctive type of Gaucher disease they termed the Norrbottnian type because of its origin from the province of Norrbotten, the northern-most county in Sweden. The severity of the clinical symptoms and signs and course of the disease differed markedly not only between families but also between sibs. Splenectomy accelerated deterioration, especially with regard to skeletal and central nervous system manifestations. Biochemical studies were performed by Hakansson (1979). The size achieved by the spleen in some cases was phenomenal. Svennerholm (1980) commented on the inappropriateness of the designation 'juvenile' in relation to some cases. Svennerholm et al. (1991) described the beneficial effects of bone marrow transplantation in this form of the disease. Although patients with type II typically have acute neurologic progression and those with type III have slow progression, Goker-Alpan et al. (2003) described 9 children with an intermediate phenotype of delayed age of onset, rapid progression of neurologic disease with refractory seizures, and oculomotor abnormalities. Based on the clinical presentation and the detected genotypic heterogeneity found by identification of all 18 alleles, Goker-Alpan et al. (2003) concluded that neuronopathic Gaucher disease is more likely to be a continuum of phenotypes from the severe perinatal cases to mild involvement with oculomotor problems. Dahl et al. (1988) found an MspI polymorphism in the glucocerebrosidase gene in 10 Swedish families affected by the Norrbottnian form of Gaucher disease. The disease segregated with 1 particular fragment in 32 meioses; only the alternative fragment was found in families with no history of Gaucher disease. The mutation appears to have occurred only once in the Swedish population. Dahl et al. (1990) showed that the Norrbottnian form of Gaucher disease is caused by the leu444-to-pro mutation (see 606463.0001). The Swedish families of the Norrbottnian type are found in 2 geographically distinct clusters. The leu444-to-pro mutation was found in one of these clusters; Dahl et al. (1993) demonstrated it also in the second cluster. Mutational analysis was combined with a genealogic reconstruction of 19 contemporary index families. Each cluster was traced back to a single ancestral couple who were not known to be related to each other; however, the molecular studies were considered compatible with a single founder who arrived in northern Sweden in or before the 16th century. There was a single connection between the 2 pedigrees as published: the mother of an affected individual in one cluster came from the other isolate. Erikson et al. (1995) reported that infusion therapy with a macrophage-targeted glucosylceramidase decreased hepatosplenomegaly, normalized hematologic parameters, and prevented progression of neurologic deterioration in all 8 of their patients treated from 13 to 29 months. Rice et al. (1996) reported a 5-year-old patient with type III Gaucher disease who was treated with enzyme replacement therapy at a dose of 60 U/kg every 2 weeks since age 2.5 years and showed no progression of neurologic involvement. Two other type III patients who were treated at the same dose beginning at ages 14 years and 41 years, respectively, showed no measurable neurologic change. Vellodi et al. (2001) reported a European consensus on the management of nonneuronopathic Gaucher disease. They recommended enzyme replacement therapy with macrophage-targeted recombinant human glucocerebrosidase and found that it ameliorates systemic involvement in nonneuronopathic as well as neuronopathic Gaucher disease, enhancing the quality of life. There was also evidence that enzyme replacement therapy reversed, stabilized, or slowed the progression of neurologic involvement in some patients. In patients with established acute neuronopathic disease, enzyme replacement therapy had little effect on the progressively downhill course. Park et al. (2003) studied 16 patients with Gaucher disease type III who were part of a rare patient subgroup manifesting progressive myoclonic epilepsy. Fourteen different genotypes were found, yet there were several shared alleles. The genotypes differed significantly from those found in most patients with type III, and the shared alleles in these patients had previously been associated with nonneuronopathic Gaucher disease. Western studies showed that the patients lacked the processed 56-kD enzyme isoform usually indicative of neuronopathic disease. Although the genotype spectrum was distinct from the rest of Gaucher type III disease, Park et al. (2003) concluded that lack of a specific shared genotype and the variability of clinical presentations indicated a contribution by other genetic and environmental modifiers.

comment: Wachtel et al. (1980) concluded that the XY female type of gonadal dysgenesis may arise through any of 4 ways: loss of the H-Y structural genes from the Y through mutation or deletion; loss of the function of an X-chromosomal regulator of H-Y (see 306100); loss of the H-Y receptor; or XY-XO mosaicism. The third of these mechanisms is probably involved in an autosomal recessive form of XY gonadal dysgenesis. These individuals are H-Y positive (Wachtel et al. (1980) reported 5 such cases), but the H-Y antigen is ineffectual because of lack of receptor on target cells (see 143150). One model of the H-Y antigen generating system suggests the requirement of at least 3 genes: the H-Y inducer gene (I) on the Y chromosome, one or more repressor genes (R) on the X, and the structural gene (S) on an autosome. The testis-determining function of the ubiquitously distributed H-Y antigen relies on a specific embryonic gonadal somatic cell receptor. The X-Y molecule may have two parts: one responsible for its organogenetic function, and one determining its antigenic activity. Moreira-Filho et al. (1982) reported an H-Y negative case of XY gonadal dysgenesis in an offspring of first-cousin parents. They suggested that the patient may be homozygous for an S locus mutation affecting both parts of the H-Y molecule. An alternative designation they used for this condition was familial testicular agenesis syndrome (FTAS). They pointed to the cases of Haseltine and Ohno (1981) and Ghosh et al. (1978) as likewise representing S mutations. Cases of H-Y antigen-positive XY gonadal dysgenesis differ from the cases just mentioned by the findings in the gonads which show testicular primordia; hence the term familial testicular dysgenesis syndrome (FTDS) suggested by Moreira-Filho et al. (1979). Parental consanguinity (Nazareth et al., 1979) and familial occurrence (Moltz et al., 1981) support an autosomal mutation, which may alter the H-Y antigen receptor or a regulator function involved in normal testicular organogenesis. Alternatively, mutation at the S locus might alter organogenetic function without destroying antigenic activity. Gonadal tumors occur frequently in FTDS but apparently not in FTAS. Thus, the H-Y antigen status can be used as a practical guide as to whether extirpation of the streak gonads is necessary. Prompted by the observation that mutations of the SOX9 gene (608160) cause campomelic dysplasia (114290), which is frequently associated with 46,XY sex reversal, Kwok et al. (1996) examined the entire coding region of the SOX9 gene in 30 46,XY patients with abnormalities of sexual development but without any skeletal abnormalities. Of the 30 patients, gonadal dysgenesis was diagnosed in 12 and partial gonadal dysgenesis in 14. Except for a C-to-T polymorphism at nucleotide 507 in 1 person, no other abnormalities of the SOX9 were found. Fuqua et al. (1996) used linkage and sequence analyses to test the role of X-linked and various autosomal genes in the etiology of the familial 46,XY partial gonadal dysgenesis. No linkage was detected between the trait and 29 markers on the X chromosome. Linkage analysis using a polymorphism within the 3-prime untranslated region of the WT1 gene excluded the involvement of autosomal loci. Similarly, linkage to 4 microsatellites on the distal short arm of chromosome 9 was excluded. Also, linkage analysis of a locus close to the SOX9 gene as well as analysis of the coding region of the SOX9 gene suggested that this gene was not associated with the trait. Le Caignec et al. (2003) described 46,XY gonadal dysgenesis in a large French kindred with various disorders of sexual development, ranging from complete female phenotype without ambiguity of the external genitalia (5 cases) to men with isolated penile or perineal hypospadias (4 cases), including 2 cases with moderate virilization and 1 case with ambiguity of the external genitalia. Histologic examination in 7 subjects yielded findings suggestive of complete gonadal dysgenesis in 1 patient, partial gonadal dysgenesis in 3 patients, and mixed gonadal dysgenesis in 3 patients. Four patients developed gonadal tumors; 2 had gonadoblastoma, 2 had dsygerminoma, and 1 had an immature teratoma, i.e., a dysgerminoma with some areas of gonadoblastoma. None of the affected subjects had other congenital anomalies or dysmorphic features. Previously reported families had implied an X-linked mode of inheritance because of the apparent absence of male-to-male transmission. However, a sex-limited autosomal dominant mode of inheritance affecting only XY individuals could not be ruled out. Analysis of the pedigree reported by Le Caignec et al. (2003) indicated an autosomal dominant mode of inheritance because of male-to-male transmission. Le Caignec et al. (2003) concluded that this family supports the involvement of at least 1 autosomal gene in nonsyndromic 46,XY gonadal dysgenesis. Jawaheer et al. (2003) performed a linkage study in the family reported by Le Caignec et al. (2003) and demonstrated by multipoint parametric analysis a lod score of 4.47, assuming sex-limited autosomal dominant inheritance with a penetrance of 0.6, for the pericentromeric region of chromosome 5 at approximately 65 cM and 57 Mb from the end of 5p. The obligatory carrier females in the kindred showed no abnormality. Jawaheer et al. (2003) concluded that the pattern of inheritance was probably more complicated than simple monogenic diseases, because 3 individuals shared the core haplotype, but did not have obvious clinical abnormalities. They proposed that in 46,XY carriers the mutant gene is highly penetrant but can be modified by a second locus. Among unaffected individuals, the associated phenotypes range from mild hypospadias without impairment of fertility to partial, or even pure, gonadal dysgenesis. In this family, a male affected with hypospadias and chordee had 2 offspring: 1 with perineal hypospadias and chordee and the other with partial gonadal dysgenesis.

comment: Several loci for holoprosencephaly have been mapped to specific chromosomal sites and the molecular defects in some cases of HPE have been identified. Holoprosencephaly-1 (HPE1; 236100) maps to 21q22.3. HPE2 (157170), caused by mutation in the SIX3 gene (603714) maps to 2p21. HPE3 (142945), caused by mutation in the sonic hedgehog gene (SHH; 600725), maps to 7q36. HPE4 (142946), caused by mutation in the TGIF gene (602630), maps to 18p11.3. HPE5 (609637), caused by mutation in the ZIC2 gene (603073), maps to 13q32. HPE6 (605934) maps to 2q37.1. HPE7, caused by mutation in the PTCH gene (601309), maps to 9q22.3. HPE8 (609408) maps to 14q13. Holoprosencephaly, which occurs with a frequency of about 1 in 16,000 live births and about 1 in 200 spontaneous abortions, is an etiologically heterogeneous entity (Muenke, 1996). There are teratogenic causes, maternal diabetes being the most significant, giving a 200-fold increased risk. Genetic factors are indicated by familial occurrence, the occurrence of holoprosencephaly in some mendelian genetic syndromes, and the association with nonrandom chromosomal aberrations. Autosomal dominant inheritance has been observed in some instances; almost all such families show mapping of the phenotype (which varies widely from cyclopia to almost no manifestation except perhaps a single middle incisor) to a locus on distal 7q. One of the genetic syndromes that includes holoprosencephaly as a feature is Smith-Lemli-Opitz syndrome (270400). Cohen (2001) discussed problems in the definition of holoprosencephaly, which can be viewed from 2 different perspectives: anatomic (fixed) and genetic (broad). When the main interest is description, the anatomic perspective is appropriate. In genetic perspective, a fixed definition of holoprosencephaly is not appropriate because the same mutational cause may result in either holoprosencephaly or some microform of holoprosencephaly. Cohen (2001) concluded that both fixed and broad definitions are equally valid and depend on context. Wallis and Muenke (2000) gave an overview of mutations in holoprosencephaly. They indicated that at least 12 different loci had been associated with HPE. Muenke (1994) reviewed holoprosencephaly as a genetic model for normal craniofacial development. He pictured the wide spectrum of facial features from cyclopia with proboscis above the single eye to ocular hypertelorism and single central upper incisor (in the father of a child with holoprosencephaly) at the other extreme. DeMyer et al. (1963) described 2 sisters with alobar holoprosencephaly of the premaxillary agenesis type, i.e., associated with median cleft lip and palate. A paternal aunt may have been identically affected. Chromosomes were normal. DeMyer et al. (1963) pointed out that there is a spectrum of holoprosencephalic disorders representing impaired midline cleavage of the embryonic forebrain. In cyclopia, the most extreme form, a single eye globe with varying degrees of doubling of intrinsic ocular structures, arrhinia and a blind-ending proboscis located above the median eye are found. In ethmocephaly, the features are extreme orbital hypotelorism, arrhinia, and a blind-ended proboscis located between the eyes. In cebocephaly, orbital hypotelorism is associated with single-nostril nose. Premaxillary agenesis is characterized by a median pseudocleft, agenesis of nasal bones and primary palate, and ocular hypotelorism. Ellis (1865) reported twins with cyclopia. Three children were affected in the family reported by Dominok and Kirchmair (1961), 1 with cyclopia and 2 with premaxillary agenesis. Cohen and Gorlin (1969) described a Chippewa Indian sibship in which 1 sib had cyclopia and 4 others had cleft lip and/or palate. The parents were related. Consanguinity was also noted in the cyclopic and cebocephalic cases of Klopstock (1921) and in the ethmocephalic infant reported by Grebe (1954). Holoprosencephaly with a different array of extracephalic malformations occurs with trisomy 13, del13q, del18p and triploidy (Holmes et al., 1974). Pfitzer and Muntefering (1968) observed 4 affected children whose mothers were relatives and had the same anomalous karyotype, thought to represent balanced translocation between chromosome 3 and a chromosome of the C group. With the introduction of G-banding techniques, Pfitzer et al. (1982) demonstrated that this reciprocal 7/C-translocation was a balanced rearrangement between the short arm of chromosome 3 and the distal part of the long arm of chromosome 7--t(3;7)(p23;q36). Burrig et al. (1989) demonstrated a fifth case of cyclopia in this family, detected prenatally, and showed an unbalanced karyotype attributable to the above-mentioned balanced translocation. They could find no reports of cyclopia associated with similar chromosome abnormalities. Lurie et al. (1990) pointed out that at least 9 cases of HPE have occurred in patients with confirmed loss of 7q34-q36; see 142945. Dallaire et al. (1971) described multiple infants with premaxillary agenesis in several different sibships of a French-Canadian kindred. James and Van Leeuwen (1970) described sibs with cebocephaly. Begleiter and Harris (1980) reported 2 brothers with holoprosencephaly, facial clefts, endocrine dysgenesis (absence of pituitary gland, hypoplastic adrenals, etc.), and micropenis. The first-born infant lived 4 months with seizure disorder and severe hypoglycemia. The second sib lived 1 day. Autopsy showed holoprosencephaly, complex brain malformations, no pituitary tissue, and hypoplastic adrenal glands with no fetal cortex. Hintz et al. (1968) reported 2 sisters with premaxillary agenesis. The sisters had 12 sibs of whom 5 died between 1 and 3 days of unknown causes but without observable malformations; 6 were normal and 1 male had growth hormone deficiency, probably on a hypothalamic basis without overt evidence of the holoprosencephaly complex (Romshe and Sotos, 1973). Anosmia and hypogonadism (Kallmann syndrome), when it occurs in both males and females (244200), may be related. Seidlitz et al. (1983) described brother and sister with full-blown holoprosencephaly without chromosomal aberration. One had cyclopia, whereas the other had cebocephaly with a proboscis. Byrne et al. (1987) described the association of congenital cytomegalovirus (CMV) infection and cyclopia. The findings support the suggestion that any infant with congenital ocular defects should be investigated for CMV infection and raises the possibility of a teratogenic role for CMV in cyclopia/holoprosencephaly. Berry et al. (1984) described an affected brother and sister. Interestingly, the father and a paternal aunt had a single central maxillary incisor and hypotelorism. The paternal grandfather was said to have had a 'skin harelip.' Zwetsloot et al. (1989) described the wide variation in brain and facial abnormalities in 3 sibs with holoprosencephaly. Munke (1989) provided an extensive review of the etiology and pathogenesis of holoprosencephaly, emphasizing heterogeneity. Collins et al. (1993) described a family in which a presumably dominant holoprosencephaly was present in 5 affected persons in 2 sibships, the offspring of healthy sisters who were thought to be gene carriers. Of the affected children, 3 had cebocephaly and died shortly after birth. One had left choanal atresia, retinal coloboma, a single central maxillary incisor, microcephaly, short stature, and learning problems. Another had only a single central maxillary incisor. Hypotelorism, microcephaly, and unilateral cleft lip and palate were possible minor manifestations in gene carriers. Estabrooks et al. (1990) described a child with a normal face but with alobar holoprosencephaly established by prenatal ultrasound examination and magnetic resonance imaging (MRI). After birth, the patient was demonstrated to have a minute deletion of 21q22.3. Estabrooks et al. (1990) suggested a causal relationship. Thus, several areas of the genome are under suspicion as the site of mutations causing holoprosencephaly. Corsello et al. (1990) reviewed the variety of chromosomal abnormalities which have been related to holoprosencephaly and also reviewed its clinical variability. They defined 3 anatomic types of holoprosencephaly: alobar (with absence of interhemispheric cleavage and single ventricle); semilobar (posterior interhemispheric fissure with rudimentary cerebral hemispheres and single ventricle); and lobar (with clear interhemispheric fissure and 2 lateral ventricles). They reported the cases of 2 male monozygotic twins who were identically affected with cyclopia, dystopic proboscis, midface hypoplasia, pseudohydrocephalus, and asymmetric atresia of apparently low-set ears. When holoprosencephaly is combined with severe facial anomalies and postaxial polydactyly, the pseudotrisomy 13 syndrome (264480) should be considered. Muenke et al. (1995) pointed out that 3 cases of HPE associated with unbalanced translocations or deletions resulting in partial monosomy of chromosome 21 had been reported, suggesting that monosomy of a gene designated HPE1 (Frezal and Schinzel, 1991) could be necessary, and perhaps sufficient, to cause HPE. By analysis of somatic cell hybrid clones that contained rearranged chromosomes 21 from HPE patients, Muenke et al. (1995) defined the HPE minimal critical region in 21q22.3 as 921S113 to qter. To determine whether there were human homologs of the Drosophila 'single-minded' (sim) gene that might be involved in HPE, they established cell hybrid mapping panels to map SIM2 to chromosome 21 within subbands 21q22.2-q22.3. Analysis of the HPE patient-derived somatic cell hybrid showed that SIM2 (see 600892) is not deleted in 2 of the 3 patients and thus is not a likely candidate for HPE1. However, SIM2 did map within the Down syndrome critical region and thus was a candidate gene for contributing to the Down syndrome phenotype. Odent et al. (1998) reviewed 258 HPE records involving at least 1 affected child and found 97 cases in 79 families with nonsyndromic, nonchromosomal HPE. A high degree of familial aggregation was found in 29% of families. By segregation analysis, Odent et al. (1998) concluded that autosomal dominant inheritance with incomplete penetrance (82% for major and 88% for major and minor) was the most likely mode of inheritance. Sporadic cases accounted for 68%, and the recurrence risk after an isolated case was predicted to be 13 to 14%. In 30 unrelated children with holoprosencephaly, Orioli et al. (2001) analyzed for mutations in the SIX3, SHH, TGIF, and ZIC2 genes. They identified 3 novel mutations, 2 in the SHH gene and 1 in the ZIC2 gene. Their results explained 8% (2 of 26 newborn samples) of the HPE cases in the South American population studied. Holoprosencephaly is associated with a diagnostic face approximately 80% of the time. Barr and Cohen (2002) reported 3 sibs with autosomal recessive alobar holoprosencephaly and essentially normal faces. A similar family was reported by Khan et al. (1970). Alobar holoprosencephaly with essentially normal faces has also been observed in infants of diabetic mothers (Barr et al., 1983). Ming and Muenke (2002) reviewed examples of digenic inheritance in human disease, in which 2 genes operate synergistically or 1 behaves as a modifier affecting severity of the phenotype. They suggested that HPE is due to mutation in more than 1 gene and that intrafamilial variability is due to multiple genetic 'hits.' They noted 3 patients who had a mutation in both SHH and a second HPE gene (Nanni et al., 1999). Dubourg et al. (2004) identified heterozygous mutations in 34 of 200 (17%) patients with holoprosencephaly: 17 mutations in the SHH gene, 7 in ZIC2, 8 in SIX3, and 2 in TGIF. Although there was significant phenotypic variation without distinct genotype/phenotype correlations, the authors reported some notable observations. Mutations in the SHH gene were associated with choanal stenosis and ophthalmologic malformations; mutation in ZIC2 was associated with anencephaly; and mutation in SIX3 was associated with atelencephaly. The observations broadened the malformations associated with HPE and suggested that phenotypic variation may be due to environmental factors. HISTORY Bazopoulou-Kyrkanidou (2005) provided a historical review of the lifestyle and behavior of the Cyclopes as described in Homer's Odyssey.

comment: A number sign (#) is used with this entry because autosomal recessive limb-girdle muscular dystrophy-2A (LGMD2A) is caused by mutation in the gene encoding the proteolytic enzyme calpain-3 (CAPN3; 114240). Autosomal recessive LGMD is a genetically heterogeneous disorder: see LGMD2B (253601) caused by mutation in the dysferlin gene (DYSF; 603009) on 2p13; LGMD2C (253700) caused by mutation in the gamma-sarcoglycan gene (SGCG; 608896) on 13q12; LGMD2D (608099) caused by mutation in the alpha-sarcoglycan gene (SGCA; 600119) on 17q12; LGMD2E (604286) caused by mutation in the beta-sarcoglycan gene (SGCB; 600900) on 4q12; LGDM2F (601287) caused by mutation in the delta-sarcoglycan gene (SCDG; 601411) on 5q33; LGMD2G (601954) caused by mutation in the TCAP gene (604488) on 17q12; LGMD2H (254110) caused by mutation in the TRIM32 gene (602290) on 9q31; LGMD2I (607155) caused by mutation in the FKRP gene (606596) on 19q13; LGMD2J (608807) caused by mutation in the titin gene (TTN; 188840) on 2q24, and LGMD2K (609308), caused by mutation in the POMT1 gene (607423) on 9q34. For a discussion of autosomal dominant LGMD (LGMD1), see 159000. CLINICAL FEATURES In a large study of patients with different forms of muscular dystrophy, Chung and Morton (1959) delineated the common features of limb-girdle muscular dystrophy. Onset usually occurred in childhood, but sometimes in maturity or middle age. Involvement was first evident in either the pelvic or, less frequently, the shoulder girdle, often with asymmetry of wasting when the upper limbs were first involved. Spread from the lower to the upper limbs or vice versa occurred within 20 years. Pseudohypertrophy of the calves was uncommon, but may have been counterfeited by a stocky build or wasting of the vasti. The rate of progression was variable, but severe disability with inability to walk was seen within 20 to 30 years of onset. Contractures and facial weakness occurred in some in late stages. Age at death was variable with the largest number of patients dying in middle age. In the analysis of Chung and Morton (1959), 59% of cases of limb-girdle muscular dystrophy could be ascribed to autosomal recessive inheritance; the remainder were sporadic cases of unknown etiology. Richard et al. (1999) reviewed the clinical information on 163 LGMD2A patients with calpain-3 mutations. They noted that Fardeau et al. (1996) had defined precise clinical features, first noted in patients from Reunion island. LGMD2A was characterized mainly by a symmetric, very selective atrophic involvement of limb-girdle and trunk muscles, with the gluteus maximus and thigh adductors being most affected. The same pattern of muscle involvement was also reported for three-fourths of the examined metropolitan French patients, with occasionally minor variations around this pattern. Similar findings were found in LGMD2A patients of Turkish or Basque origin. Mean age at onset was 13.7 years (range, 2 to 40 years) and the mean age at loss of walking ability was 17.3 years (range, 5 to 39 years). No sex difference was evident in age at onset or disease progression. Using linkage studies to characterize 13 Brazilian families with autosomal recessive LGMD, Passos-Bueno et al. (1996) found that the approximately 33% of families had LGMD2A and 33% had LGMD2B, whereas 17% had LGMD2D, and less than 10% had LGMD2C. Patients with LGMD2B appeared to have the mildest phenotype, with an average age at onset that was significantly later than for patients with LGMD2A. Passos-Bueno et al. (1999) studied 140 patients from 40 Brazilian families with one of 7 autosomal recessive limb-girdle muscular dystrophies. All LGMD2E and LGMD2F patients had a severe phenotype; considerable inter- and intrafamilial variability was observed in all other types of LGMD. Comparison between 40 LGMD2A patients and 52 LGMD2B patients showed that LGMD2A patients had a more severe course and higher frequency of calf hypertrophy (86% vs 13%), and that LGMD2B patients were more likely to be unable to walk on toes (70% vs 18%). Mercuri et al. (2005) reported skeletal muscle MRI findings of 7 patients with LGMD2A who had early contractures. The 3 younger patients were able to walk independently and had selective impairment of the adductor magnus and semimembranosus muscles. The 4 older patients all had restricted ambulation and had similar involvement of the adductor magnus as well as more diffuse involvement of the posterolateral thigh muscles and vastus intermedius. Two 'control' patients with LGMD2A without contractures showed similar muscle involvement. Mercuri et al. (2005) suggested that patients with LGMD2A have a somewhat unique pattern of muscle involvement on MRI, which may serve to differentiate the disorder from Emery-Dreifuss muscular dystrophy (EDMD; see, e.g., 310300) and Bethlem myopathy (158810), both of which have phenotypic similarities to LGMD2A. DIAGNOSIS Among 58 patients with LGMD2A confirmed by mutation analysis, Fanin et al. (2004) found that 46 (80%) had a variable degree of calpain-3 protein deficiency determined by immunoblot analysis, and 12 (20%) had normal amounts of calpain-3. The probability of having LGMD2A was very high (84%) when patients had a complete calpain-3 deficiency and progressively decreased with increasing amounts of protein detected. CAPN3 gene mutations were identified in 46 of 69 (67%) patients with calpain-3 protein deficiency and in 12 of 139 (9%) patients with normal calpain-3 protein. Patients with severe, early-onset disease usually had no calpain-3 protein, but absent or markedly reduced protein levels were also detected in patients with adult onset. However, almost all patients with normal calpain-3 levels had late or adult onset of the disorder. - Differential Diagnosis Walton and Nattrass (1954) introduced the term 'limb-girdle muscular dystrophy' as part of a classification that achieved wide acceptance and did much to resolve earlier confusion. Over the next 30 years it became clear that many inherited and acquired disorders could produce a similar clinical picture, such as nemaline myopathy (e.g., 256030), central core disease (117000), thyrotoxic myopathy, various scapuloperoneal syndromes (e.g., 181430), chronic polymyositis, and, spinal muscular atrophy (e.g., 253300). Many of the early reported cases of 'limb-girdle' muscular dystrophy likely had one of these conditions. Attempting total ascertainment of LGMD in the Lothian area of Scotland, Yates and Emery (1985) collected 10 index cases of adult-onset (at or after age 18) LGMD. In the 10 sibships, only 1 had a second case; however, in this family the 2 brothers may have had Becker muscular dystrophy (BMD; 300376). Assuming recessive inheritance, there was a significant deficiency of affected persons and a great preponderance of males (9 out of 10). Arikawa et al. (1991) analyzed diagnostic muscle biopsies in 41 cases with the clinical diagnosis of limb-girdle muscular dystrophy at the National Institute of Neuroscience in Tokyo. Using immunofluorescence, immunoblot analysis, and PCR analysis to examine diagnostic muscle biopsies, they identified 5 male patients with an abnormal dystrophin (300377) pattern diagnostic of Becker muscular dystrophy and 2 female patients with dystrophin patterns consistent with a manifesting carrier of Duchenne muscular dystrophy (DMD; 310200). Thus, 17% of the limb-girdle patients showed a 'dystrophinopathy,' with 31% (4/13) of isolated males misclassified and 13% (2/15) of isolated females misclassified. The study emphasized the clinical overlap between LGMD and dystrophinopathies and reinforced the necessity of dystrophin protein and gene studies for accurate clinical diagnosis. MAPPING In an inbred population descended from French settlers of the island of Reunion, Beckmann et al. (1991) mapped the LGMD locus to proximal 15q by demonstration of linkage to D15S25 (lod score = 5.52 at theta = 0.0). In studies of the Old Order Amish in Indiana, Young et al. (1991, 1992) found linkage to 15q15-q22 (maximum lod score of 5.92 at theta = 0.08). Passos-Bueno et al. (1993) found informative results in 8 of 11 large Brazilian LGMD families of different racial backgrounds: linkage to 15q markers was established in 2 of these families and excluded in 6 others, indicating genetic heterogeneity. By screening the CEPH YAC libraries with probes flanking the LGMD2 locus within a 7-cM interval, Fougerousse et al. (1994) refined the cytogenetic LGMD2A locus to 15q15.1-q21.1. Allamand et al. (1995) constructed a physical map of the 7-cM region 15q15.1-q21.1 by means of a 10- to 12-Mb continuum of overlapping YAC clones and localized the LGMD2A gene to the proximal part of this region in both Amish families and families from the Island of Reunion. Analysis of the interrelated pedigrees from Reunion revealed at least 6 different carrier haplotypes, suggesting that multiple LGMD2A mutations may segregate in this population. - Genetic Heterogeneity Beckmann (1991) identified several families with recessive LGMD in which linkage with 15q was excluded, indicating genetic heterogeneity. Allamand et al. (1995) found unexpected genetic heterogeneity of LGMD among the Indiana Amish; linkage of LGMD to chromosome 15 was excluded in 6 Amish kindreds from southern Indiana. Notably, these 6 kindreds were related by multiple consanguineous links to the same northern Indiana families in which involvement of chromosome 15 was previously demonstrated (Young et al., 1992). Allamand et al. (1995) also excluded the form of autosomal recessive muscular dystrophy related to a locus on 2p (LGMD2B) as the site of the mutation in the southern Indiana Amish. Lim et al. (1995) demonstrated that the mutation in the individuals with LGMD in the southern Indiana Amish involved the beta-sarcoglycan gene (600900.0001); this form was referred to as limb-girdle muscular dystrophy-2E. MOLECULAR GENETICS In families with LGMD2 linked to chromosome 15, Richard et al. (1995) identified mutations in the calpain-3 gene; in all, 15 nonsense, splice site, frameshift, or missense calpain-3 mutations were found to segregate with the disease. Six of the mutations were found in Reunion island patients. To account for the unexpected presence of multiple independent mutations in the small inbred population on La Reunion island, Richard et al. (1995) proposed a digenic inheritance model. The results demonstrated an enzymatic rather than a structural protein defect causing muscular dystrophy, and suggested that the defect may have regulatory consequences, perhaps in signal transduction. In discussing the digenic model of Richard et al. (1995), van Ommen (1995) suggested that polygenic disease may be less complex than often thought and that the interaction between 1 major gene and 1 or a few modifiers may explain much of complex genetics. Zlotogora et al. (1996) suggested that multiple mutations in a single specific gene in a small geographic area may be a common phenomenon. They referred to 3 different iduronidase (252800) mutations causing Hurler syndrome (607014) in 4 different non-Jewish families in the Galilee region of Israel (Bach et al., 1993) and 5 different mutations in the arylsulfatase A gene (607574) causing metachromatic leukodystrophy (250100), occurring on at least 3 different haplotypes in the same region (Heinisch et al., 1995). Richard et al. (1999), who referred to this disorder as 'calpainopathy,' stated that 97 distinct pathogenic CAPN3 mutations had been identified: 4 nonsense mutations, 32 deletions/insertions, 8 splice site mutations, and 53 missense mutations, together with 12 polymorphisms and 5 unclassified variants. The mutations, most of which represented private variants, were distributed along the entire length of the CAPN3 gene. POPULATION GENETICS Pfaendler (1950) reported an affected Swiss pedigree which was studied further by Touraine (1955). Jackson and Carey (1961) found the same type of autosomal recessive muscular dystrophy in the descendants of Swiss immigrants in an Amish isolate in Indiana. Moser et al. (1966) found autosomal recessive muscular dystrophy to be 4 times more frequent in the Canton of Berne than in other countries studied. He mapped the places of origin of the parents of cases within the canton, which proved to be the same area as those from which the Amish family names were derived. Urtasun et al. (1998) reported the highest prevalence rate of LGMD described to that time in Guipuzcoa, a small mountainous Basque province in northern Spain: 69 per million. Genetic studies demonstrated that 38 cases corresponded to LGMD2A due to calpain-3 gene mutations. Only 1 patient with alpha-sarcoglycanopathy was found, and in 12 patients the genetic defect was not identified. The particular calpain-3 mutation predominant in Basques (exon 22, 2362AG-to-TCATCT; 114240.0006) had only rarely been found in the rest of the world. The clinical characteristics of the patients with calpain-3 gene mutations were quite homogeneous and different from the other groups, allowing for a precise clinical diagnosis. Disease onset was between ages 8 and 15 years, occurring in the pelvic girdle in most cases, and patients became wheelchair-bound between 11 and 28 years after onset. No pseudohypertrophy of calves or contractures were observed. Fanin et al. (2005) determined that the prevalence of LGMD2A in northeastern Italy was 9.47 per million. Two founder mutations in the CAPN3 gene (114240.0009; 114240.0010) were identified. HISTORY By an ingenious mathematical analysis, Morton (1960) concluded that homozygosity at either of 2 loci may result in limb-girdle muscular dystrophy and that about 1.6% of the normal population is heterozygous for a limb-girdle muscular dystrophy gene. Rudman et al. (1972) concluded that patients are at least 7 times more sensitive to growth hormone than are normals. Using probes on human chromosome 6q flanking the dystrophin-related sequence, Passos-Bueno et al. (1991) performed linkage analysis in 226 persons from 19 Brazilian families with autosomal recessive LGMD. They excluded linkage of LGMD to both MYB (6q22-q23) and ESR (6q24-q27) at theta = 0.10, as well as to TCP1 (6q25-q27) at theta = 0.05, and concluded that the dystrophin-homologous sequence on chromosome 6q was not the gene responsible for LGMD.

comment: A number sign (#) is used with this entry because a number of genes have been found to carry mutations associated with pancreatic carcinoma, either familial or sporadic. These include MADH4 (600993), TP53 (191170), and ARMET (601916). Mutations in the CDKN2A gene (600160) can result in pancreatic cancer in association with melanoma (see 606719). Point mutations in codon 12 of the KRAS2 gene (190070) occur in 75 to 95% of pancreatic cancers, and also occur in foci of pancreatic intraepithelial neoplasia, a putative precursor lesion of pancreatic cancer. Individuals with mutations in the BRCA2 gene (600185), which predisposes to breast and ovarian carcinoma, have an increased risk of pancreatic cancer; germline mutations in BRCA2 are the most common inherited alteration identified in familial pancreatic cancer (Murphy et al., 2002). Friedman and Fialkow (1976) observed cancer of the pancreas in 4 brothers from a sibship of 6. Diagnosis was made between ages 66 and 75 years. None had a history of pancreatitis or tumors at other sites. Reimer et al. (1977) reported pancreatic cancer in father and son. Pancreatic carcinoma occurs in the von Hippel-Lindau syndrome (193300), hereditary pancreatitis (Appel, 1974), and ataxia-telangiectasia (Swift et al., 1976). In a family of European Jewish ancestry, Ehrenthal et al. (1987) identified pancreatic adenocarcinoma in women of 3 successive generations. The diagnosis was histologically confirmed in each case. The youngest of the 3 women presented at age 29, her mother at age 42, and her grandmother at age 76. When Billy Carter, brother of President Jimmy Carter, died of pancreatic cancer in 1988, the news media reported that his sister Jean Carter Stapleton, evangelist and faith healer, had died of pancreatic cancer at age 54 and their mother of pancreatic, bone, and breast cancer at age 85. In the New York Times of December 1, 1989, it was announced that President Carter's last surviving sib, Gloria Carter Spann, was found to be suffering from pancreatic cancer, 'the same disease that killed their father, sister, and brother, and contributed to the death of their mother.' The possibility of environmental causation might be raised, e.g., an agricultural insecticide or an oncogenic agent such as aflatoxin. Lynch et al. (1995) studied 8 families in which 2 or more first-degree relatives had pancreatic cancer. In the 8 families, 25 pancreatic cancers were found. The mean age of occurrence was 62.8 years, with a range from 45 to 90 years. Parent and child occurrence was observed in 4 of the 8 families. In one family, the progenitor had an affected brother and 5 of his 8 children developed cancer; 2 had pancreatic cancer, 2 had breast cancer (one of these also had pancreatic cancer), and 1 daughter had ovarian cancer. Of the 7 carcinomas available for pathologic review, 6 were typical ductal adenocarcinomas and the seventh was a giant cell variant of ductal carcinoma. Caldas et al. (1994) quoted Boring et al. (1993) as indicating that pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma is the fourth leading cause of cancer death in either sex in the United States, with an estimated incidence in 1993 of nearly 27,700 and a mortality of 24,500. Although KRAS mutations are found in 85% or more of cases and p53 mutations (191170) in at least of 50% of cases, little is known of the genetic changes that occur in pancreatic carcinogenesis. Caldas et al. (1994) described experiments suggesting that mutation in the p16 gene (CDKN2; 600160), which they referred to as MTS1, is a frequent cause of pancreatic adenocarcinoma. Liu et al. (1995) found that 50% of pancreatic cancer cell lines had deletions of both exons 1 and 2 of the CDKN2 gene; furthermore, an additional 30% of pancreatic cancer cell lines harbored point mutations or microdeletions based on DNA sequencing. Evans et al. (1995) described a large pedigree in which pancreatic cancer was inherited as an autosomal dominant. Diabetes and exocrine insufficiency were observed in all family members who eventually developed pancreatic cancer. The presence of diabetes, often years before the diagnosis of cancer, allowed identification of those people who had inherited the predisposing allele. The germline mutation that was responsible for the predispositioned pancreatic cancer was unknown. However, since the KRAS2 gene is mutated in 75 to 90% of cases of sporadic pancreatic cancer (Almoguera et al., 1988), Evans et al. (1995) analyzed this gene in pancreatic tumors from patients in this family. Pancreatic tissue from all 3 persons analyzed showed KRAS point mutations and in all 3 the mutations were located in codon 13. The observation of several different KRAS mutations in pancreatic tumors from this family and the presence of only wildtype KRAS in normal tissue clearly showed that the mutant KRAS gene was not the germline event underlying pancreatic cancer in this family. The lack of attacks of abdominal pain seemingly distinguishes the affected members of this family from hereditary pancreatitis (167800) in which diabetes mellitus and pancreatic cancer occur, but the distinction is by no means clear because it was stated that 6 of the 9 persons who developed pancreatic cancer in this family also had a history clinically compatible with pancreatic insufficiency before diagnosis of cancer: weight loss, fatty and foul smelling stools, increased fecal fat, and relief with exogenous pancreatic enzyme supplementation. All 9 members of the family with pancreatic cancer were males. Schutte et al. (1995) observed that, although pancreatic adenocarcinoma is relatively frequent, description of the genetic alterations has been hampered for several reasons. Because of the aggressive clinical course, the number of resected specimens, especially at early stages of the cancer, have been somewhat limited. Furthermore, pancreatic adenocarcinomas characteristically exhibit an exuberant host desmoplastic response, resulting in a high mixture of nonneoplastic cells and hampering the molecular genetic analysis of primary tumor samples. Finally, familial patterns of pancreatic adenocarcinoma usually do not involve young ages of onset, high penetrance, or extensive pedigrees. Schutte et al. (1995) used the method of representational difference analysis (RDA), as described by Lisitsyn et al. (1995), to demonstrate a homozygous deletion mapping to a 1-cM region at 13q12.3. The deletion was flanked by the markers D13S171 and D13S260 and lay within the 6-cM region identified as containing the BRCA2 locus of heritable breast cancer susceptibility. This suggests that the same gene may be involved in multiple tumor types and that its function is that of a tumor suppressor rather than that of a dominant oncogene. RDA is a means for isolating DNA fragments that are present in only 1 of 2 nearly identical complex genomes. It utilizes a subtractive hybridization method but differs from conventional methods by using 'representations' of the genomes that have a reduction in complexity. Representations are generated by a PCR-based size selection applied to the restriction fragments of both genomes. Moreover, RDA takes advantage of both subtractive hybridization and DNA reassociation kinetics to favor the reiterated PCR amplification of the difference between the 2 genomes. RDA can enrich difference products over a million-fold after 3 rounds of selection. The patient in whose pancreatic cancer the homozygous deletion was demonstrated was an 84-year-old woman who had successful resection of a right-sided colon carcinoma at the age of 61. Her mother had had an adenocarcinoma of the colon resected and died of breast carcinoma at age 80. Her mother's sister died of breast carcinoma at age 94. Her mother's brother died of 'stomach' cancer in his 80s. The patient's brother died of colorectal cancer at the age of 52. Whether the members of this kindred were hemizygous for the deletion in the 13q12.3 region was not determined; Schutte et al. (1995) stated that 'it will be of interest to determine whether the individuals of the presently reported familial cluster are hemizygous in (this) region.' Further evidence of the role of CDKN2 in pancreatic tumorigenesis was provided by Whelan et al. (1995), who described a kindred with an increased risk of pancreatic cancers, melanomas, and possibly additional types of tumors cosegregating with a CDKN2 mutation (600160.0005). Making use of pathologic, clinical, and genetic knowledge, Hruban et al. (2000) composed a progression model of pancreatic carcinoma, similar to that developed for colorectal carcinoma. Several familial cancer syndromes increase the risk of pancreatic cancer. The best characterized include the hereditary nonpolyposis colon cancer syndrome (HNPCC; see 1204335), hereditary breast-ovarian cancer syndrome due to mutations in BRCA2, Peutz-Jeghers syndrome (175200), and familial atypical multiple mole melanoma syndrome (FAMMM; 155600) caused by mutations in the CDKN2A gene (600160). The patients with hereditary pancreatic cancer resulting from gain-of-function mutations in the protease serine-1 gene (PRSS1; 276000) have a lifetime pancreatic cancer risk ratio of 57 and a cumulative incidence, to age 70 years, of 40% (Lowenfels et al., 1997). Banke et al. (2000) estimated that 10% or more of patients with pancreatic cancer inherit the risk in an autosomal dominant pattern. A most striking example was 'family X' described by Brentnall et al. (1999) and Meckler et al. (2001). The primary characteristics included early age at onset (median age 43 years) and high penetrance (more than 80%) of pancreatic cancer. Some family members developed pancreatic insufficiency before the onset of cancer. A surveillance program in this and other kindreds with familial pancreatic cancer had been developed, using endoscopic ultrasound and endoscopic retrograde pancreatography, to help identify patients with precancerous changes. All of the precancerous changes (dysplasia) were verified histologically. Eberle et al. (2002) performed a genomewide linkage screen and found significant linkage (maximum lod score 4.56 in 2-point analysis and 5.36 in 3-point analysis) on chromosome 4q32-q34. See pancreatic cancer, susceptibility to, 1 (PNCA1; 606856). To investigate the role of germline mutations in the etiology of pancreatic cancer, Murphy et al. (2002) analyzed samples from patients from kindreds in which 3 or more family members were affected with the disease, at least 2 of which were first-degree relatives. By direct sequencing of constitutional DNA, they analyzed 4 tumor suppressor candidate genes: MAP2K4 (601335), MADH4, ACVR1B (601300), and BRCA2. These genes are mutated in clinically sporadic pancreatic cancer, but germline mutations had either not been reported or were anecdotal in familial pancreatic cancer. In the first 3 of the 4 genes, no germline mutations were found, suggesting that they are unlikely to account for a significant number of inherited pancreatic cancers. On the other hand, BRCA2 gene sequencing revealed that 5 patients from the 29 kindreds tested (17.2%) had mutations that had previously been reported to be deleterious; a point mutation (met192 to thr) of unknown significance was also identified. Three patients harbored the common 6174delT frameshift mutation (600185.0009), 1 had the splice site mutation IVS16-2A-G, and 1 had a novel splice site mutation IVS15-1G-A. A family history of breast cancer was reported in 2 of the 5 BRCA2 mutations carriers; none reported a family history of ovarian cancer. These findings confirmed an increased risk of pancreatic cancer in individuals with BRCA2 mutations and identified germline BRCA2 mutations as the most common inherited genetic alteration in familial pancreatic cancer. Berman et al. (2003) demonstrated that a wide range of digestive tract tumors, including most of those originating in the esophagus, stomach, biliary tract, and pancreas, but not in the colon, display increased hedgehog pathway activity, which is suppressible by cyclopamine, a hedgehog pathway antagonist. Cyclopamine also suppresses cell growth in vitro and causes durable regression of xenograft tumors in vivo. Unlike tumors in Gorlin syndrome (109400), pathway activity and cell growth in these digestive tract tumors are driven by endogenous expression of hedgehog ligands, as indicated by the presence of Sonic hedgehog (SHH; 600725) and Indian hedgehog (IHH; 600726) transcripts, by the pathway- and growth-inhibitory activity of a hedgehog-neutralizing antibody, and by the dramatic growth-stimulatory activity of exogenously added hedgehog ligand. Berman et al. (2003) concluded that their results identified a group of common lethal malignancies in which hedgehog pathway activity, essential for tumor growth, is activated not by mutation but by ligand expression. Thayer et al. (2003) reported that Sonic hedgehog is abnormally expressed in pancreatic adenocarcinoma and its precursor lesions, pancreatic intraepithelial neoplasia. The pancreata of Pdx1- (600733) Shh mice (in which Sonic hedgehog is misexpressed in the pancreatic endoderm) developed abnormal tubular structures, a phenocopy of human pancreatic intraepithelial neoplasia-1 and -2. Moreover, these pancreatic intraepithelial neoplasia-like lesions also contained mutations in Kras (190070) and overexpressed Erbb2 (164870), which are genetic mutations found early in the progression of human pancreatic cancer. Furthermore, hedgehog signaling remained active in cell lines established from primary and metastatic pancreatic adenocarcinomas. Notably, inhibition of hedgehog signaling by cyclopamine induced apoptosis and blocked proliferation in a subset of the pancreatic cancer cell lines both in vitro and in vivo. Thayer et al. (2003) concluded that their data suggested that the hedgehog pathway may have an early and critical role in the genesis of pancreatic cancer, and that maintenance of hedgehog signaling is important for aberrant proliferation and tumorigenesis. McWilliams et al. (2005) analyzed family history questionnaires from 426 patients with pancreatic cancer and compared the prevalance of malignancy reported in 3,355 of their first-degree relatives to population data from the Surveillance, Epidemiology, and End Results (SEER) Project, using age- and gender-adjusted incidence rates. McWilliams et al. (2005) found an increased risk of pancreatic and liver carcinoma in the first-degree relatives of probands with pancreatic cancer (1.88- and 2.7-fold, respectively); the risk for pancreatic cancer was nearly 3-fold when the proband was diagnosed before 60 years of age, but no other malignancies were increased in this subgroup.

comment: Human male germ cell tumors (GCT) result from malignant transformation of premeiotic or early meiotic germ cells and exhibit embryonal-like differentiation of the 3 germinal layers. The genetic basis of malignant transformation and expression of differentiated phenotypes by the transformed cells are poorly understood. Germ cell tumors (GCTs) are the most common malignant neoplasm of males aged 15 to 34 and a major cause of death due to cancer in this age group. Hutter et al. (1967) reviewed the reports of testicular tumors in brothers and in twins and reported affected brothers. Gustavson et al. (1975) reported bilateral testicular teratoma in 2 infant brothers with XXY Klinefelter syndrome. One of them also had hydrocephalus due to stenosis of the aqueduct of Sylvius. Familial occurrence of the Klinefelter syndrome is rare. The association of the Klinefelter syndrome and testicular teratoma may be more than coincidental because they have been observed together in other cases and many testicular teratoma are both X-chromatin and Y-chromatin positive suggesting that they are XXY. Raghavan et al. (1980) reported a father who had sequential bilateral seminomas and a son who had embryonal cell carcinoma and seminoma. The authors reviewed 5 other reports of testicular tumors in father and son, as well as 7 reports of concordant monozygotic twin pairs and 11 reports of nontwin brothers. The report of Raghavan et al. (1980) illustrates the dominant inheritance of hereditary tumors and their bilaterality (e.g., acoustic neuroma, retinoblastoma, pheochromocytoma, etc.). The sons (and other first-degree relatives) of men with bilateral tumors may be at particular risk. Shinohara et al. (1980) reported mature testicular teratoma in 2 first cousins. Furthermore, the common grandparents were consanguineous, being related as first cousins. The parent (i.e., the parent involved in the consanguinity) of the teratoma-carrying boys was the mother in one case and the father in the other. In a 10-member sibship in a Spanish-American family, DiBella (1983) described testicular neoplasm in 3 brothers, benign ovarian neoplasms in 2 sisters, suspected benign tumors of the uterus in 2 additional sisters, and a suspected testicular mass in a fourth brother. Lynch et al. (1985) described the infantile form of embryonal carcinoma of the testis in a 5-year-old boy and in a 23-year-old man who was the maternal half brother of his mother. Copeland et al. (1986) reported testicular embryonal carcinoma in 2 brothers and a first cousin. Von der Maase et al. (1986) found carcinoma in situ in the contralateral testis in 27 of 500 patients (5.4%) with unilateral testicular germ cell cancer. The estimated risk of developing invasive growth from the contralateral testicular cancer was 40% within 3 years and 50% within 5 years. None of the 473 patients without carcinoma in situ detected by screening biopsy developed contralateral testicular cancer after an observation time ranging from 12 to 96 months. These observations suggested to the authors that there is a subset of this type of testicular cancer that is genetic and has a bilateral predisposition. The authors suggested that all such carcinomas begin as carcinoma in situ. Von der Maase et al. (1986) recommended that all patients with unilateral testicular germ cell cancer should be offered biopsy of the contralateral testis. Of the 27 patients, 16 had a cancer that was labeled seminoma and 11 had a cancer that was considered to be nonseminoma. It would be of great interest to know the median age of the patients with contralateral carcinoma in situ as contrasted with the others. If these represent a subset who had inherited 1 of the 2 mutations according to the Knudson theory, then the patients with contralateral carcinoma in situ should have an earlier average age of development of carcinoma. Patel et al. (1990) reported 6 cases of familial testicular cancer: 4 father-son pairs, a pair of brothers, and a 23-year-old man who had a maternal uncle with testicular cancer. In the U.K., according to Forman et al. (1992), 42 families with 2 or more cases of testicular cancer were reported to the familial testicular cancer registry. These families included 2 pairs of identical twins, 27 sets of other brothers (25 pairs, 2 triples), 9 father-son pairs, 2 pairs of first cousins, and 2 uncle-nephew pairs. In all, 91 testicular tumors were described in 86 persons. Pure seminoma was present in 46% and other germ cell tumors in 54%. The median age at diagnosis was significantly younger than in a comparable series of nonfamilial patients. The cumulative risk of developing testicular cancer by the age of 50 years for a brother of a patient was estimated to be 2.2%, which results in a relative risk of 9.8 in comparison with the general population. No significant peculiarity of class I HLA type was found in a study of 21 affected sib pairs. Studying direct preparations and 24-hr cultures, Atkin and Baker (1982) found an isochromosome for the short arm of chromosome 12 in all of 10 seminomas, 1 malignant teratoma, and 1 combined seminoma and teratoma of the testis. (The same workers found a possible isochromosome for 5p in 12 of 18 carcinomas of the cervix.) They also noted a relative excess of normal chromosomes 12 in 4 of 5 of the seminomas analyzed in detail. Castedo et al. (1989) found at least 1 copy of a 12p isochromosome in 8 of 10 seminomas. Thus, the authors concluded that amplification of 1 or more genes on the short arm of chromosome 12 may be important in the development of malignant testicular tumors. Chromosomal changes presumably lead to the malignant phenotype by gene loss, gene modification or gene amplification. Lothe et al. (1989) found loss of heterozygosity (LOH) for 3p or 11p sequences in 40% of testicular cancers. Samaniego et al. (1990) analyzed the karyotype of 24 male germ cell tumors from both testicular and extragonadal sites and belonging to the histologic categories seminoma, teratoma, embryonal carcinoma, choriocarcinoma, and endodermal sinus tumor. In 90% of tumors, including all histologic subtypes and both gonadal and extragonadal presentation, they found isochromosome 12p. In contrast, they found del(12)(q13-q22) exclusively in nonseminomatous GCTs, and mixed GCTs occurring in 44% of such lesions. They developed a method based on DNA analysis for detecting i(12p) as increased copy number of 12p. Furthermore, they detected cytologic evidence of gene amplification in 12p in the form of homogeneously staining regions (HSRs) and double minute chromosomes in both treated and untreated primary extragonadal and metastatic GCTs. Suijkerbuijk et al. (1991, 1992) applied competitive in situ hybridization (CISH) techniques (Kievits et al., 1990) to show that the aberrant chromosome in testicular germ cell tumors is indeed an isochromosome-12p. Other marker chromosomes representing translocation products that involve chromosome 12 were also identified. In the studies, DNAs from 2 rodent-human somatic cell hybrids, containing either a normal chromosome 12 or the p arm of chromosome 12 as their unique human material, were used as probes. (Competitive in situ hybridization, also referred to as chromosome painting, employs large pools of cloned genomic sequences originating from a single human chromosome as probe and involves a preannealing step in the presence of an excess of sonicated total human DNA. It results in complete staining of the particular chromosome in metaphase spreads and in interphase nuclei. Kievits et al., 1990 stated that the approach permits detection of hitherto undetectable chromosomal aberrations.) In a cytogenetic analysis of 65 consecutively ascertained GCTs with chromosomal abnormalities, Rodriguez et al. (1992) found that an isochromosome for the short arm of chromosome 12 (i(12p)), monosomy 12, and deletions in 12q occurred with frequencies of 86%, 11%, and 20% respectively. Their data strongly suggested that loss of genetic material on 12q characterizes the development of these tumors. To define the region of common deletion in GCTs at the molecular level, Murty et al. (1992) compared germline and tumor genotypes for 8 polymorphic loci in paired normal/tumor DNA samples from 45 GCT patients. Analysis demonstrated 2 regions of loss of constitutional heterozygosity, one at 12q13 and the other at 12q22. One tumor exhibited homozygous deletion of a region of 12q22 which includes the MGF gene (184745). The MGF and KIT (164920) genes have been shown to play key roles in embryonal and postnatal development of germ cells. The MGF gene product constitutes the ligand for the receptor encoded by the KIT protooncogene. They evaluated the expression of these 2 genes by Northern blot analysis in a panel of 3 GCT cell lines and 24 fresh GCT biopsies. Deregulated expression of MGF and KIT, which was discordant between seminomatous and nonseminomatous lesions, was observed. Murty et al. (1994) refined their data on the mapping of male germ cell tumors (MGCTs). Using 5 dinucleotide repeats mapping to 12q22, they found LOH in approximately 41% of tumors; one of the loci, D12S218, showed LOH in 37% of tumors, suggesting the presence of a tumor suppressor gene in its vicinity. In this study, a panel of 66 tumor DNA samples and their corresponding normal cells were investigated. Because a marker chromosome interpreted as isochromosome 12p is present in most testicular tumors of germ cell origin, Peltomaki et al. (1992) investigated 22 patients with testicular germ-cell tumors by Southern blot hybridization to characterize changes in chromosome 12. In comparison with normal DNA, tumor DNA of 18 patients showed increased dosages of 12p accompanied by a comparable or smaller increase or no change in the dosage of centromeric sequences of chromosome 12. The interpretation offered by the authors was that most testicular tumors had one or several isochromosomes for 12p that were formed by somatic division of the centromere and that the points of breakage and reunion in the centromeric region were different in different tumors. Sex-limited parental imprinting was excluded by the fact that allelic 12p fragments showing increased intensity were paternal in 4 and maternal in 3 of 7 informative cases. Furthermore, the observed patterns of allelic fragments suggested that the marker isochromosome was formed by sister chromatids of 1 homolog number 12 rather than the result of interchange of genetic material between different homologs. Forman et al. (1992) reported an epidemiologic study that showed an 8- to 10-fold increase in relative risk of testicular cancer to brothers of patients and a 4-fold increase in risk to fathers and sons. Families with multiple cases of testicular cancer are rare and almost all those reported have only 2 affected members. Leahy et al. (1995) performed a sib-pair analysis on 35 families in which there were either 2 or 3 affected brothers. These families were typed for 220 autosomal microsatellite markers spaced 10-20 cM throughout the genome. Six regions that gave a lod score of more than 1.0 on formal linkage analysis or a P value of 0.05 or less using a nonparametric approach were considered as candidate regions for a susceptibility gene. Of particular interest was one region on chromosome 4. A positive lod score of 2.6 on multipoint analysis was obtained with 2 neighboring probes in the region of 4cen-q13. Although testicular teratomas occur as part of the spectrum of cancers in the Li-Fraumeni syndrome (151623) due to mutations in the P53 gene (191170), the molecular basis of most familial cases of testicular teratoma is unknown. Huddart et al.(1996) raised the question of whether the familial predisposition extends to familial germ cell tumors as well as male germ cell tumors. They identified 3 families suggesting this possibility. In 1, the proband presented with a seminoma at the age of 51, his brother had had a testicular teratoma at the age of 28, and their cousin had an endodermal sinus tumor of the ovary diagnosed at 32 years. In the second family, the index case presented with an undifferentiated malignant teratoma at 28 years of age and his sister was diagnosed with bilateral mature teratomatous cysts at the age of 39. In the third family, the index case presented with a retroperitoneal teratoma at 26 years and his sister was diagnosed with an ovarian dysgerminoma at 45 years. Huddart et al. (1996) noted that none of these families had any features indicative of the Li-Fraumeni syndrome or any other cancer family syndrome. Trentini and Palmieri (1974) and Yule et al. (1994) reported single families with ovarian and testicular germ cell tumors and Jackson (1967) presented a family with multiple cases of dysgerminoma. Heimdal et al. (1996) found that 51 of 922 (5.5%) Norwegian patients with testicular cancer and 5 of 237 (2.1%) Swedish patients had a relative with confirmed testicular cancer. It was a first-degree relative who was affected in the case of 32 of the probands. Standardized incidence ratios (SIRs) were 10.2 for brothers, 4.3 for fathers, and 5.7 for sons. The estimate for the risk to brothers in the Norwegian part of the sample for development of testicular cancer by the age of 60 was 4.1%. Patients with familial testicular cancer had bilateral tumors more often than sporadic cases (9.8% bilaterality in familial vs 2.8% in sporadic cases; P = 0.02). For patients with seminoma, age of onset was lower in familial than in sporadic cases (32.9 vs 37.6 years; P = 0.06). Heimdal et al. (1996) stated that the prevalence of undescended testis did not seem to be higher in familial than in sporadic testicular cancer. In a detailed deletion mapping analysis of 67 normal-tumor DNA comparisons using 20 polymorphic markers mapped to 12q22-q24, Murty et al. (1996) identified the limit of the minimal region of deletion at 12q22 between D12S377 (proximal) and D12S296 (distal). They constructed a YAC contig map of a 3-cM region of this band and developed a radiation hybrid (RH) map of the region. The consensus order developed by RH mapping was in good agreement with the YAC STS-content map order. The RH map estimated the distance between the D12S101 and D12S346 to be 246 cR(8000) and the minimal region of deletion to be 141 cR(8000). In addition, 4 genes that were previously mapped to 12q22 were excluded as candidate genes: mast cell growth factor (184745), B-cell translocation gene-1 (109580), thymopoietin (188380), and neural precursor cell expressed, developmentally down-regulated-1 (600372). Murty and Chaganti (1998) reviewed the genetics of male germ cell tumors. A characteristic of GCTs is high sensitivity to cisplatin-based chemotherapy. Chromosomal and molecular cytogenetic studies identified multiplication of 12p, manifested in i(12p) or tandem duplication of 12p, as a unique change in GCTs which serves as a diagnostic marker. Ectopic overexpression of cyclin D2 (CCND2; 123833), which maps to 12p, as early as in carcinoma in situ, identified CCND2 as a candidate gene in germ cell transformation. Genetic alterations identified in the tumor suppressor genes DCC (120470), RB1 (180200), and nonmetastatic protein-23 (NME1; 156490) in GCTs suggested that their inactivation plays a key role in transformation or differentiation. The exquisite sensitivity of these tumors to chemotherapy is reflected in their overexpression of wildtype p53 protein and lack of TP53 mutations. Zafarana et al. (2002) identified the DADR (609860), SOX5 (604975), and ETNK1 (609858) genes within a region of chromosome 12p amplified in testicular seminomas. Although all 3 genes were amplified to the same level in seminomas with the amplification, only DADR expression was significantly upregulated. DADR was also highly expressed in nonseminomas of various histologies and derived cell lines lacking the 12p amplification. Low DADR expression was observed in normal testicular parenchyma and in parenchyma containing carcinoma in situ. DADR overexpression in seminomas and nonseminomas correlated with invasive growth, reduced apoptosis, and earlier clinical manifestation. Einhorn (2002) stated that the highest worldwide incidence of germ cell tumors is in Scandinavian countries; by contrast, testicular cancer is rare in African Americans. The primary age group is 15 to 35 years for nonseminomatous tumors and a decade older for seminomas. Although cases are few, germ cell tumors are important because they represent the most common carcinoma in men aged 15 to 35 years and thus have the potential to greatly shorten productive years of life. Available serum markers such as alphafetoprotein (104150) and human chorionic gonadotropin have allowed clinicians to make important and accurate treatment-related decisions. Testicular cancer is a model for multidisciplinary care, as surgical resection of postchemotherapy radiographically persistent disease can improve the cure rate. Germ cell tumors have become an excellent testing ground for experimental drugs, a number of which were first approved by the Food and Drug Administration primarily on the basis of data in testicular cancer. Ottesen et al. (2004) studied 3 brothers with germ cell tumors. One had an intracranial tumor in the pineal region and the other 2 had testicular tumors. No abnormalities were detected in peripheral blood with karyotyping and molecular marker analysis of selected loci. High-resolution comparative genomic hybridization (CGH) analysis of microdissected histologic components of the overt tumors and the adjacent carcinoma in situ demonstrated a pattern of genomic imbalances characteristic for sporadic GCTs, including gain of 12p. A 1.6-Mb deletion of the Y chromosome that removes part of the AZFc region--known as the gr/gr deletion (see 415000)--has been associated with infertility. In epidemiologic studies, male infertility has shown an association with testicular germ cell tumor (TGCT) that is out of proportion with what can be explained by tumor effects. Thus, Nathanson et al. (2005) hypothesized that the gr/gr deletion may be associated with TGCT. They analyzed this deletion in a large series of TGCT cases with or without a family history of TGCT. The gr/gr deletion was present in 3% of TGCT cases with a family history. 2% of TGCT cases without a family history, and 1.3% of unaffected males. The presence of the gr/gr deletion was associated with a 2-fold increased risk of TGCT and a 3-fold increased risk of TGCT among patients with a positive family history. The gr/gr deletion was more strongly associated with seminoma TGCT than with nonseminoma TGCT. Thus, the Y microdeletion gr/gr appears to be a rare, low penetrance allele that confers susceptibility to TGCT. ANIMAL MODEL In laboratory mice, testicular germ cell tumors (TGCTs) arise from primordial germ cells (PGC) in only the inbred 129 strain, and susceptibility is under multigenic control (Stevens and Hummel, 1957). The spontaneously arising mutation Ter (Stevens, 1973) on mouse chromosome 18 (Asada et al., 1994; Sakurai et al., 1994) increases TGCT frequency on a 129/Sv background. Youngren et al. (2005) reported the positional cloning of Ter, revealing a point mutation that introduces a termination codon in the mouse Dnd1 gene (609385). PGC deficiency was corrected both with BACs containing Dnd1 and with a Dnd1-encoding transgene. Dnd1 is expressed in fetal gonads during the critical period when TGCTs originate. Dnd1 has an RNA recognition motif and is most similar to the apobec (see 600130) complementation factor, a component of the cytidine to uridine RNA editing complex. These results suggested that Ter may adversely affect essential aspects of RNA biology during PGC development. Youngren et al. (2005) stated that Dnd1 was the first protein known to have an RNA recognition motif directly implicated as a heritable cause of spontaneous tumorigenesis, and they suggested that TGCT development in the 129-Ter mouse strain models pediatric TGCTs in humans. Collin et al. (1996), in a genome scan of tumor-bearing progeny from backcrosses between the 129/Sv-Ter/+ and MOLF/Ei strains provided modest evidence that MOLF-derived alleles on mouse chromosome 19 enhance development of bilateral TGCTs. To obtain independent evidence for linkage to the MOLF chromosome, Matin et al. (1999) made an autosomal chromosome substitution strain (a so-called consomic strain, or CSS), in which chromosome 19 of 129/Sv +/+ was replaced by its MOLF-derived homolog. The unusually high frequency of TGCTs in this CSS (even in the absence of the Ter mutation) provided evidence confirming the genome survey results, identified linkage for a naturally occurring strain variant allele that confers susceptibility to TGCTs, and illustrated the power of CSSs in complex trait analysis.

comment: Tibial hemimelia is a rare anomaly characterized by deficiency of the tibia with relatively intact fibula. Jones et al. (1978) classified the anomaly into 4 types according to radiologic criteria. It may present as an isolated anomaly or be associated with a variety of skeletal and extraskeletal malformations. Tibial hemimelia may also constitute a part of a more complicated malformation complex or syndrome, such as the Gollop-Wolfgang complex (228250) and triphalangeal thumb-polysyndactyly syndrome (see 190605 and 188770) (Matsuyama et al., 2003). Emami-Ahari and Mahloudji (1974) described bilateral absence of the tibia in 3 children, 2 males and 1 female, of phenotypically normal but related parents. No other anomalies were present and intelligence was normal. Jones et al. (1978) reported affected brother and sister. McKay et al. (1984) reported affected sisters. McKay et al. (1984) reviewed syndromes of congenital defects in which tibial hemimelia is a feature. Richieri-Costa et al. (1987) reported on 37 patients belonging to different families who had the tibial hemimelia/split-hand/split-foot syndrome. Quoting others, they suggested that the maximum risk to the offspring of an affected person married to an unaffected person is 8.6% and the maximum risk to a sib of an isolated patient is 12.5%. They suggested that there are 4 well-established and 2 other possible autosomal dominant tibial hemimelia syndromes in addition to 2 types with autosomal recessive inheritance. Richieri-Costa (1987) reported a Brazilian child, born to consanguineous but healthy parents, who had cleft lip/palate in addition to tibial hemimelia. Stevens and Moore (1999) described a girl with Langer-Giedion syndrome (LGS; 150230), a contiguous gene syndrome caused by deletion in the 8q24.1 region. The patient also showed bilateral tibial hemimelia and unilateral absence of the ulna. Turleau et al. (1982) had described an 8-year-old boy with LGS and bilateral tibial hemimelia. Although no genes involving limb development in the human had been identified in the 8q24.1 region, 2 mouse syndromes with limb abnormalities mapped to the homologous region of 9A1-A4: 'luxoid' (absent toes, radial and tibial hemimelia, preaxial polydactyly, bent tail, and oligospermia) and 'aft' (abnormal feet and tail). Stevens and Moore (1999) suggested that a gene involved in limb development is contiguous with the gene(s) for LGS and that deletion of this gene causes tibial hemimelia. Matsuyama et al. (2003) reported 2 Japanese brothers, aged 6 and 2 years, with tibial hemimelia, who were born to unrelated, phenotypically normal parents. The type of tibial hemimelia and associated malformations of hands and feet were quite different between the brothers. Findings in the elder brother were compatible with the Gollop-Wolfgang complex, and in the younger brother with tibial aplasia-ectrodactyly syndrome (119100). No mutations were found in 3 candidate genes: Sonic hedgehog (SHH; 600725), HOXD11 (142986), and HOXD12 (142988).

comment: A number sign (#) is used with this entry because the phenotype can be caused by mutation in the endothelin-B receptor gene (EDNRB; 131244), in the gene for its ligand, endothelin-3 (EDN3; 131242), or in the SOX10 gene (602229). DESCRIPTION Waardenburg-Shah syndrome (WS4) is a disorder of the embryonic neural crest that combines clinical features of Waardenburg syndrome (see 193500) and Hirschsprung disease (142623). CLINICAL FEATURES Shah et al. (1981) reported studies of 5 families in which a total of 12 babies (7 male; 5 female) with white forelock and white eyebrows and eyelashes presented in the neonatal period with intestinal obstruction. Eight patients had isochromia irides (light brown irides with mosaic pattern); in the other 4, information was not recorded. In 6 patients in whom the observations were recorded, no dystopia canthorum, broad nasal root, or white skin patches were found. Deafness could not be detected in any of the patients. Microcolon was noted in patients in whom contrast enemas were done. At operation, the proximal ileum was dilated with collapse of the distal ileum and colon in 8; operative notes were not available on the other 4. The 12 infants died 3 to 38 days after birth because of failure of the ileostomy to function. This disorder appeared to be clinically and genetically distinct from Waardenburg syndrome, which has a different pigmentary anomaly of the eye and usually does not have associated Hirschsprung disease, although the short segment type may rarely occur in WS. In 3 of 6 Mexican sibs, Liang et al. (1983) observed Hirschsprung disease in association with 'bicolored' irides. They used the term bicolored rather than heterochromia to emphasize that 2 distinct colors were present in the same iris. The unaffected parents were related, suggesting autosomal recessive inheritance. Liang et al. (1983) suggested a defect in the neural crest. Kulkarni et al. (1989) described 3 sibs derived from an uncle-niece marriage who had white forelock, light-colored irides, white eyelashes, multiple hypopigmented skin patches, and obstructive ileal lesions. Edery et al. (1996) reported a 4-year-old girl, born to unrelated parents, with total colonic aganglionosis, bilateral sensorineural hearing loss, and pigmentary anomalies, including achromic patches of the skin, white eyelashes, pale blue retina, but absence of dystopia canthorum found in Waardenburg syndrome. INHERITANCE Shah et al. (1981) reported parental consanguinity in 2 of 5 affected families as well as multiple affected sibs of both sexes in families, suggesting autosomal recessive inheritance. One family was ascertained through a first cousin of a patient with WS4; this proband had white forelock and heterochromia iridis, but no dystopia canthorum or deafness, as in classic Waardenburg syndrome. Badner and Chakravarti (1990) analyzed the 5 families reported by Shah et al. (1981) and Ambani (1983). Because 2 of the families demonstrated parental consanguinity, autosomal recessive inheritance had been suggested. Badner and Chakravarti (1990) concluded, however, that a single dominant gene with pleiotropic effects, with a more severe phenotype in homozygotes, was more plausible. MAPPING Van Camp et al. (1995) reported a patient with characteristics of Waardenburg syndrome type 2 (see WS2A; 193510) and a de novo interstitial deletion of 13q. The authors also described another family in which 2 sibs had WS2 and Hirschsprung disease; in this family, there was evidence for a disease locus on chromosome 13q. MOLECULAR GENETICS Puffenberger et al. (1994) reported an extensive Mennonite kindred with many cases of Hirschsprung disease (600155). In individuals with Hirschsprung disease as well as bicolored irides (6.3%), hypopigmentation (2.5%), sensorineural hearing loss (5.1%), and white forelock (7.6%) suggestive of WS4, Puffenberger et al. (1994) identified a mutation in the EDNRB gene (131244.0001). The mutation was found to be dose sensitive, in that the homozygotes and heterozygotes had a 74% and a 21% risk, respectively, of developing Hirschsprung disease. In a patient with WS4, Edery et al. (1996) identified a homozygous substitution/deletion mutation of the EDN3 gene (131242.0001). In a child with WS4, Pingault et al. (2001) identified a heterozygous nonsense mutation in the EDN3 gene (131242.0007). Three unaffected relatives and a fetus terminated at 29 weeks' gestation because of intestinal obstruction also had the mutation. The fetus was found to have Hirschsprung disease affecting the ileum and colon, but no features of Waardenburg syndrome. ANIMAL MODEL In the mouse, at least 3 megacolon genes are associated with pigmentary abnormalities (Lane, 1966, 1984). Defects in the gene encoding the endothelin-B receptor result in aganglionic megacolon and pigmentary disorders in mice and humans. Baynash et al. (1994) found that targeted disruption of the mouse endothelin-B ligand (Edn3) gene produces a similar recessive phenotype of megacolon and coat color spotting. Southard-Smith et al. (1998) identified Sox10 as the gene underlying the Dom Hirschsprung mouse model. Matsushima et al. (2002) described a novel mutant mouse with a mutation in the Ednrb gene and proposed the mouse as an animal model of Waardenburg syndrome type IV. These mutants had a mixed genetic background and extensive white spotting. They died between 2 and 7 weeks after birth owing to megacolon; their colon distal to the megacolon lacked Auerbach plexus cells. These mutants did not respond to sound, and the stria vascularis of their cochleas lacked intermediate cells, i.e., neural crest-derived melanocytes. The inheritance was autosomal recessive as in human WS4. Breeding analysis revealed that WS4 mice are allelic with piebald-lethal and JF1 mice, which are also mutated in the Ednrb gene. Mutation analysis showed that the Ednrb gene lacked 318 nucleotides encoding transmembrane domains owing to deletion of exons 2 and 3.

synonym: "METHYL-CpG-BINDING PROTEIN 2" RELATED []
comment: CLONING Lewis et al. (1992) identified and cloned Mecp2 from a rat brain cDNA library. The deduced 492-amino acid protein has a molecular mass of 53 kD and is rich in basic amino acids and potential phosphorylation sites. Immunofluorescent staining showed that the distribution of Mecp2 along chromosomes parallels that of methyl-CpG. In the mouse, Mecp2 is concentrated in pericentromeric heterochromatin, which contains about 40% of all genomic 5-methylcytosine. Unlike methyl-CpG-binding protein-1 (MBD1; 156535), MECP2 is able to bind a single methyl-CpG pair. Nan et al. (1993) cloned the rat Mecp2 gene and defined the methyl-CpG-binding domain (MBD). The MBD is 85 amino acids long and binds exclusively to DNA that contains 1 or more symmetrically methylated CpGs. Using a rat MECP2 probe to screen a human skeletal muscle cDNA library, D'Esposito et al. (1996) isolated the human homolog, which encodes a deduced 485-amino acid protein. The human and rat proteins share 93% overall sequence identity and 100% identity in the MBD region. Northern blot analysis detected a 1.8-kb transcript in all tissues analyzed, with the highest level of expression in heart and skeletal muscle. Mnatzakanian et al. (2004) identified a theretofore unknown isoform of MECP2 that they called MECP2B. They referred to the known isoform as MECP2A. The MECP2B transcript utilizes exon 1 of MECP2, skips exon 2, and then uses full-length exons 3 and 4. MECP2B is expressed in all tissues, including fetal and adult brain and brain subregions. In adult human brain, MECP2B expression is 10 times higher than that of MECP2A. GENE STRUCTURE Reichwald et al. (2000) determined that the human MECP2 gene has 4 exons. MAPPING Quaderi et al. (1994) mapped the mouse Mecp2 gene to a 40-kb interval between L1cam and Rsvp in the central span of the mouse X chromosome, close to the microsatellite marker DXMit1. This region is known to be syntenically equivalent to human Xq28, and, with the exception of F8A, locus order is conserved between the 2 species. Therefore, D'Esposito et al. (1996) expected the human MECP2 gene to be located between L1CAM (308840) and the RCP/GCP color vision loci. A filter containing all YACs localized between these 2 points was hybridized with the rat Mecp2 probe, and 3 overlapping YACs were positive for MECP2, placing MECP2 about 70 kb centromeric to the RCP/GCP color vision cluster. By fluorescence in situ hybridization, Vilain et al. (1996) confirmed the Xq28 map position of MECP2. GENE FUNCTION Inactivation of X-linked genes is usually associated with methylation of the CpG island at the 5-prime end of the gene. Proteins that recognize and bind to methylated bases in DNA include the methylated DNA-binding protein MECP2. To determine whether this gene is expressed from the inactive X chromosome, Adler et al. (1995) used an X/autosome translocation system in the mouse in which expression from the Mecp2 allele on the inactive X chromosome could be assayed. Results from these experiments indicated that Mecp2 is subject to X inactivation in mouse. D'Esposito et al. (1996) demonstrated that the MECP2 gene in humans is subject to X inactivation. To find out whether the heterochromatic localization of MECP2 depends on DNA methylation, Nan et al. (1996) transiently expressed rat Mecp2-LacZ fusion proteins in cultured cells. Intact protein was targeted to heterochromatin in wildtype cells but was insufficiently localized in mutant cells with low levels of genomic DNA methylation. Deletions within Mecp2 showed that localization to heterochromatin required the 85-amino acid methyl-CpG binding domain but not the remainder of the protein. Thus, Mecp2 is a methyl-CpG-binding protein in vivo and is likely to be a major mediator of downstream consequences of DNA methylation. MECP2 is an abundant chromosomal protein that binds specifically to methylated DNA in vitro and depends upon methyl-CpG for its chromosomal distribution in vivo. To assess its functional significance, Tate et al. (1996) mutated the X-linked gene in male mouse embryonic stem (ES) cells using a promoterless gene-targeting construct containing a lacZ reporter gene. Mutant ES cells lacking MECP2 grew with the same vigor as the parental line and were capable of considerable differentiation. Chimeric embryos derived from several independent mutant lines, however, exhibited development defects with a severity that was positively correlated with the distribution of mutant cells. The results demonstrated to the authors that MECP2, like DNA methyltransferase (126375), is dispensable in stem cells but is essential for embryonic development. Nan et al. (1997) found that native and recombinant rat Mecp2 repressed transcription in vitro from methylated promoters but did not repress nonmethylated promoters. Moreover, Mecp2 was able to displace histone H1 (HIF1; 142709) from preassembled chromatin that contains methyl-CpG. These properties, together with the abundance of Mecp2 and the high frequency of its 2-bp binding site, suggested a role as a global transcriptional repressor in vertebrate genomes. Nan et al. (1998) studied the mechanism of repression by Mecp2. Mecp2 binds tightly to chromosomes in a methylation-dependent manner. It contains a transcriptional-repression domain (TRD) that can function at a distance in vitro and in vivo. Nan et al. (1998) showed that a region of Mecp2 that localizes with the TRD associates with a corepressor complex containing the transcriptional repressor mSin3A and histone deacetylases (see HDAC1, 601241). Transcriptional repression in vivo is relieved by the deacetylase inhibitor trichostatin A, indicating that deacetylation of histones (and/or of other proteins) is an essential component of this repression mechanism. The data suggested that 2 global mechanisms of gene regulation, DNA methylation and histone deacetylation, can be linked by Mecp2. In Xenopus oocytes, DNA methylation dominantly silences transcription through the assembly of a repressive nucleosomal array. Jones et al. (1998) found that silencing conferred by Mecp2 and methylated DNA can be relieved by inhibition of histone deacetylase, facilitating the remodeling of chromatin and transcriptional activation. These results established a direct causal relationship between DNA methylation-dependent transcriptional silencing and the modification of chromatin. Ohki et al. (2001) reported the solution structure of the conserved MBD of human MBD1 bound to methylated DNA. DNA binding causes a loop in MBD1 to fold into a major and novel DNA-binding interface. Recognition of the methyl groups and CG sequence at the methylation site is due to 5 highly conserved residues that form a hydrophobic patch. The authors concluded that the structure indicates how the MBD may access nucleosomal DNA without encountering steric interference from core histones. Shahbazian et al. (2002) investigated the spatial and temporal distribution of the Mecp2 protein during mouse and human development. By Western blot analysis, they found that Mecp2 in the adult mouse is high in the brain, lung, and spleen, lower in heart and kidney, and barely detectable in liver, stomach, and small intestine. There was no obvious correlation between protein levels and RNA levels, suggesting that translation may be posttranscriptionally regulated by tissue-specific factors. The timing of Mecp2 expression in mouse and human correlated with the maturation of the central nervous system, with the ontogenetically older structures such as the spinal cord and brainstem becoming positive before newer structures such as the hippocampus and cerebral cortex. In the cortex, Mecp2 first appeared in the Cajal-Retzius cells, then in the neurons of the deeper, more mature cortical layers, and finally in the neurons of the more superficial layers. The Mecp2 protein was eventually present in a majority of neurons but was absent from glial cells. Shahbazian et al. (2002) suggested that Mecp2 may become abundant only once a neuron has reached a certain degree of maturity. Chen et al. (2003) found that MECP2 binds selectively to BDNF (113505) promoter III and functions to repress expression of the BDNF gene. Membrane depolarization triggers the calcium-dependent phosphorylation and release of MECP2 from BDNF promoter III, thereby facilitating transcription. Chen et al. (2003) concluded that MECP2 plays a key role in the control of neuronal activity-dependent gene regulation and that the deregulation of this process may underlie the pathology of Rett syndrome (312750). Martinowich et al. (2003) reported that increased synthesis of BDNF in mouse neurons after depolarization correlates with a decrease in CpG methylation within the regulatory region of the BDNF gene. Moreover, increased BDNF transcription involves dissociation of the MECP2-histone deacetylase-(see 601241)-Sin3A (607776) repression complex from its promoter. Martinowich et al. (2003) concluded that DNA methylation-related chromatin remodeling is important for activity-dependent gene regulation that may be critical for neural plasticity. Martinowich et al. (2003) proposed a model in which DNA methylation and its related chromatin remodeling play critical roles in regulating gene transcription response to neuronal activity. CpG methylation at any critical site may increase the likelihood of MECP2 binding, which can recruit histone deacetylases and the H3-K9 methyltransferase to mediate inactive chromatin remodeling, or may directly induce chromatin compaction to repress gene expression. Harikrishnan et al. (2005) found that BRM (SMARCA2; 600014) associated with MECP2 in mouse fibroblasts and human T-lymphoblastic leukemia cells, and the association was functionally linked with repression. Promoter methylation specified the recruitment of MECP2 and BRM, and inhibition of methylation caused their release. The MECP2-BRM corepressor complex was directly recruited to the FMR1 gene, and somatic knockdown in fragile X cells alleviated the repression. Harikrishnan et al. (2005) concluded that both MECP2 and components of the SWI/SNF complex are involved in gene repression. Klose et al. (2005) found that genomic sites occupied by MECP2 and MBD2 (603547) were largely mutually exclusive. MBD2 was able to colonize sites vacated by MECP2 depletion, but the reverse was not true. Artificial selection of MECP2-binding sites in vitro demonstrated that MECP2 required an A/T run of 4 or more base pairs adjacent to the methyl-CpG for efficient DNA binding. Klose et al. (2005) concluded that methyl-CpG is necessary, but not sufficient, for MECP2 binding. MOLECULAR GENETICS Rett syndrome (RTT; 312750) is a progressive neurologic developmental disorder and one of the most common causes of mental retardation in females. Because RTT occurs almost exclusively in females, it had been proposed that RTT is caused by an X-linked dominant mutation with lethality in hemizygous males. Using a systematic mutation analysis of genes located in the Xq28 region containing the locus for Rett syndrome, Amir et al. (1999) identified mutations in the MECP2 gene as the cause of some cases of RTT. In 5 of 21 sporadic patients with RTT, Amir et al. (1999) found 3 de novo missense mutations in the region encoding the highly conserved methyl-binding domain of the MECP2 gene (300005.0001, 300005.0002, 300005.0007), as well as a de novo frameshift and a de novo nonsense mutation (300005.0021), both of which disrupted the transcription repression domain. Among 8 cases of familial Rett syndrome, Amir et al. (1999) found segregation of an additional missense mutation (300005.0008) in 1 family with 2 affected half sisters. The mutation was not detected in their obligate carrier mother, suggesting that the mother was a germline mosaic for this mutation. The authors suggested that the findings point to abnormal epigenetic regulation as a mechanism underlying the pathogenesis of Rett syndrome. Wan et al. (1999) reviewed the mutations identified by Amir et al. (1999) and added 5 additional mutations (see, e.g., 300005.0003, 300005.0020). Of these, 5 were missense mutations, 5 were protein-truncating mutations, and 1 was a variant type of mutation. They found that missense mutations causing Rett syndrome were de novo and affected conserved domains of MECP2. All of the nucleotide substitutions involved C-T transitions at CpG hotspots. They presented evidence that some males with RTT-causing MECP2 mutations may survive to birth, and female heterozygotes with favorably skewed X-inactivation patterns may have little or no involvement. Cheadle et al. (2000) identified mutations in 44 of 55 (80%) unrelated classic sporadic and familial RTT patients (see, e.g., 300005.0004), but in only 1 of 5 (20%) sporadic cases with suggestive, but nondiagnostic features of RTT. Twenty-one different mutations were identified (12 missense, 4 nonsense, and 5 frameshift mutations); 14 of these were novel. All missense mutations were located either in the methyl-CpG-binding domain or in the transcription repression domain. Nine recurrent mutations were characterized in a total of 33 unrelated cases (73% of all cases with MECP2 mutations). Significantly milder disease was noted in patients carrying missense mutations as compared with those with truncating mutations (P = 0.0023), and milder disease was associated with late as compared with early truncating mutations (P = 0.0190). Bienvenu et al. (2000) identified 30 mutations among 46 RTT patients, including 12 novel mutations (11 in exon 3 and 1 in exon 2). Mutations such as R270X (300005.0005) and frameshift deletions in a (CCACC)n-rich region were found with multiple recurrences; most of the mutations were de novo. Although mutations in noncoding regions could not be excluded for 35% of their cases, the authors proposed that a putative second X-linked gene may exist. Huppke et al. (2000) found mutations in 24 of 31 RTT patients; in at least 20 patients the mutation was de novo. Confirming 2 earlier studies, most mutations were truncating, and only a few were missense mutations. Several females carrying the same mutation displayed different phenotypes, suggesting that factors other than the type or position of mutations influence the severity of RTT. In 19 of 26 Japanese patients with sporadic Rett syndrome, Amano et al. (2000) identified 12 different mutations in the MECP2 gene, 8 of which were novel. De Bona et al. (2000) explored the spectrum of mutations affecting the MECP2 gene in a group of 25 classic Rett syndrome girls and in 3 patients with the preserved speech variant (PVS) of Rett syndrome. They noted 2 hotspots: R270X (300005.0005) and R294X (300005.0011). Among the preserved speech variants, 2 patients carried deletions of 41 bp (300005.0012) and 44 bp (300005.0014), respectively, which were strikingly similar to deletions observed in classic Rett syndrome. Thus, the allelism of the variant form to the classic form was established. Xiang et al. (2000) reported mutation analysis of the MECP2 gene in 59 sporadic cases of Rett syndrome and 9 families with a total of 19 affected individuals. Mutations were found in 27 of the sporadic cases but in none of the familial cases. Mutation analysis of the UBE1 (314370), UBE2I (601661), GDX (312070), SOX3 (313430), GABRA3 (305660), and CDR2 (117340) genes, which the authors regarded as candidate genes on the basis of clinical, pathologic, and genetic features, was also performed in 10 'classical' cases. No mutations were found in any of these genes in any individuals. Gene expression of MECP2, GDX, GABRA3, and L1CAM (308840) was investigated by in situ hybridization studies of post mortem brain tissue samples from 6 affected individuals and 7 controls. No gross differences were observed in the neurons of several brain regions between normal controls and Rett patients. Buyse et al. (2000) identified several novel mutations n the MECP2 gene. Bourdon et al. (2001) achieved a mutation detection rate of 79% among 47 cases of classic RTT and 25% among 8 nonclassic RTT cases. Combining their findings with those previously reported, the spectrum of mutations in the MECP2 gene associated with RTT encompassed missense (34%), nonsense (46%), and frameshift (20%) mutations. The occurrence of mutations mainly in exon 3 (89%) and the multiple recurrence of specific mutations pointed to mutation hotspots that could propose diagnostic strategies for RTT. Three missense mutations, R106W (300005.0008), T158M (300005.0007), and R306C (300005.0016), represented about 23% of all mutations in their study and about 16 to 32% in the literature. Together with 4 nonsense mutations, a total of 7 mutations represented 64% of those found by Bourdon et al. (2001) and an even higher proportion (72%) in the patients studied by Amir et al. (1999). In 26 of 30 Danish RTT patients, Nielsen et al. (2001) identified 15 different de novo mutations in the MECP2 gene, of which 5 were novel. Novel mutations included a 1-bp deletion (300005.0018) and a 14-bp duplication (300005.0019). The 30 patients were sporadic cases, chosen from 69 known RTT patients in Denmark because of availability of DNA samples. Twenty-seven of the patients were diagnosed with classic RTT and 3 as forme fruste variants with a milder phenotype. The authors performed direct sequencing of the coding region and parts of the 5-prime and 3-prime UTR. Nineteen of the 26 detected mutations were C-T transitions at CpG dinucleotides. Three of the 4 patients without identified mutations (all with classic RTT) were analyzed by FISH, and gross rearrangements of the MECP2 region were excluded. X-chromosome inactivation (XCI) was found to be random in 19 and skewed in 9 patients (2 were not informative); in 8 patients the paternal X chromosome was preferentially inactivated. The authors found no consistent correlation between the type (truncating or missense) or position of mutations and the severity of clinical presentation. Furthermore, the XCI pattern in peripheral blood did not seem to influence the score. The authors concluded that the clinical inclusion criteria are the most important factors in relation to the mutation detection rate. In a study of 116 patients, including 91 with classic and 25 with atypical RTT, Hoffbuhr et al. (2001) identified causative mutations in the MECP2 gene in 63% of the patients, representing a total of 30 different mutations. Mutations were identified in 72% of patients with classic RTT, but in only one-third of patients with atypical RTT. The authors found 17 novel mutations, including a complex gene rearrangement involving 2 deletions and a duplication in 1 individual. The duplication was identical to a region within the 3-prime UTR, and represented the first report of involvement of this region in RTT. Mutations in the N terminus were significantly correlated with a more severe clinical presentation compared with mutations closer to the C terminus of MECP2. Skewed X-inactivation patterns were found in 2 asymptomatic carriers of MECP2 mutations and in 6 girls diagnosed with either atypical or classic RTT. In 35 of 50 Italian girls with classic Rett syndrome, Nicolao et al. (2001) identified 19 different de novo MECP2 mutations, 8 of which were novel. In a total of 22 unrelated cases, 7 recurrent mutations were characterized. Initial DHPLC screening allowed the identification of 17 of the 19 mutations (90%); after optimal conditions were established, this figure increased to 100%, with all recurrent MECP2 mutations generating a characteristic chromatographic profile. They found a tendency in this series for milder disease to be associated with nonsense mutations as compared to patients carrying missense mutations, although the difference was not statistically significant (p = 0.077). Pan et al. (2002) identified 12 different mutations in the MECP2 gene in 17 out of 31 (55%) sporadic Chinese classic RTT patients. The mutations (4 missense, 3 nonsense, and 5 frameshift) were all in the third exon and 2 were novel. Truncating mutations within or downstream of the TRD or deletions in the C-terminal region were consistent with reduced clinical severity when compared with truncating mutations N-terminal to this domain. Trappe et al. (2001) analyzed the parental origin of MECP2 mutations in sporadic cases of RTT by analysis of linkage between the mutation in the MECP2 gene and intronic polymorphisms in 27 families with 15 different mutations, and found a high predominance of mutations of paternal origin (26 of 27 cases). The paternal origin was independent of type of mutation and was found for single-base exchanges as well as for deletions. Parents were not of especially advanced age. Trappe et al. (2001) concluded that de novo mutations in RTT occur almost exclusively on the paternally derived X chromosome and that this is probably the cause for the high female:male ratio observed in patients with RTT. Affected males have been described in a few cases of familial inheritance. Identification of the parental origin may be useful to distinguish between the sporadic form of RTT and a potentially familial form. Miltenberger-Miltenyi and Laccone (2003) stated that 218 different mutations in the MECP2 gene had been reported in more than 2,100 patients. The mutations, which are responsible for up to 75% of classic RTT cases, are distributed along the whole gene and comprise all types of mutations. Almost all cases are sporadic. Christodoulou et al. (2003) described RettBASE, a database for mutations in the MECP2 gene responsible for Rett syndrome and other abnormalities. Mnatzakanian et al. (2004) screened the exon 1 sequence, which is utilized in the MECP2B isoform, in 19 girls with typical Rett syndrome in whom no mutations had been found in the other exons. In 1 affected individual, they identified an 11-bp deletion in exon 1 (300005.0028). This deletion does not affect the expression of MECP2A, indicating that inactivation of the MECP2B isoform is sufficient to cause Rett syndrome. - Males with Mutations in the MECP2 Gene Meloni et al. (2000) stated that there had been no reports of males with Rett syndrome with a mutation in the MECP2 gene who survived beyond the age of 1 year. They studied a 3-generation family in which 2 affected males showed severe mental retardation and progressive spasticity (see 300279) and 2 obligate carrier females showed either normal or borderline intelligence, simulating an X-linked recessive trait. This family had previously been reported by Claes et al. (1997), who mapped the disorder to Xq27.2-qter. Meloni et al. (2000) found that the affected males and the carrier females had a mutation (300005.0009) in the MECP2 gene, demonstrating that, in males, MECP2 can be responsible for severe mental retardation associated with neurologic disorders. Orrico et al. (2000) found a novel mutation (A140V; 300005.0015) in the MECP2 gene in a female with mild mental retardation, her similarly affected daughter, and her 4 adult sons with severe mental retardation. The results indicated that not all MECP2 mutations are lethal in males and that they can cause nonspecific X-linked mental retardation (MRX16; 300458). Couvert et al. (2001) identified 2 mutations, not found in RTT, in families with nonspecific X-linked mental retardation (see, e.g., E137F; 300005.0017). Upon screening a cohort of 185 mentally retarded males who were negative for the expansions across the FRAXA CGG repeat, 2 were found to carry the A140V. Two other patients also carried mutations. The authors found the frequency of mutations in the MECP2 gene comparable to the frequency of the CGG expansions in the gene that causes fragile X syndrome (FMR1; 309550) and suggested systematic screening of MECP2 in mentally retarded patients. Ylisaukko-oja et al. (2005) screened the MECP2 gene in 118 unrelated mentally retarded Finnish patients (103 males, 15 females). They identified 2 known polymorphisms in the coding sequence and 4 variants in the intronic or 3-prime UTR regions, but stated that none of these was likely to be causal. Ylisaukko-oja et al. (2005) concluded that the evidence in their own and other mutation screening studies implies that MECP2 mutations do not represent a major cause of nonspecific mental retardation. Moncla et al. (2002) reviewed a total of 13 MECP2 mutations reported in males. The first cases demonstrated a variant phenotype of Rett syndrome characterized by severe neonatal encephalopathy and lethality in early childhood. In those cases, the carrier mothers had totally skewed X-chromosome inactivation. Further mutations were associated with nonspecific X-linked mental retardation, but also sporadic cases were described with a wide spectrum of mental retardation varying from a severe form with an Angelman syndrome (105830) phenotype to moderately mentally retarded males. In a series of 23 unrelated boys with severe mental retardation either with a variant phenotype of Rett syndrome or an Angelman-like phenotype, Moncla et al. (2002) identified 2 missense mutations in the C-terminal domain of the MECP2 gene. The first mutation was also detected in a healthy male cousin of the proband and the second mutation had been described previously as a polymorphism. The authors noted that the findings highlighted the need for extreme caution in the clinical interpretation of sequence variation in the MECP2 gene, before genetic counseling or prenatal diagnosis is proposed to the families involved. Yntema et al. (2002) performed MECP2 mutation analysis in a cohort of 475 mentally retarded males who were negative for the FMR1 CGG repeat expansion. Fourteen different sequence changes were detected, 4 of which were previously reported as nonpathogenic variants and 5 that were novel silent changes. Five changes were possible mutations not described before, including 4 amino acid changes and a deletion of 2 bases. For 3 of the 4 amino acid changes, segregation analysis revealed that the mutations could be traced in unaffected male family members. One missense mutation was inherited from the mother, but no other family members were available for further segregation analysis. This change, however, involved a nonconserved amino acid, making it unlikely that it has a dramatic effect on the MECP2 protein. Finally, a de novo deletion of 2 bases resulting in a frameshift and premature stop codon was described in a patient with moderate mental retardation, emotional disturbances, gynecomastia, and generalized obesity, previously reported by Kleefstra et al. (2002). The frequency of MECP2 mutations in the Dutch mentally retarded males was therefore 0.2%, (1 of 475) and the study revealed the crucial importance of segregation analysis for low frequency mutations, in order to distinguish them from rare polymorphisms. Hoffbuhr et al. (2001) identified MECP2 mutations in 2 males: a Klinefelter male with classic RTT (300005.0007) and a hemizygous male infant with an Xq27-q28 inversion and a novel 32-bp frameshift deletion. Kleefstra et al. (2002) reported a 10-year-old boy with moderate mental retardation, hypotonia, obesity, and gynecomastia and a de novo 2-bp deletion in the MECP2 gene that resulted in a frameshift and premature stop codon. They pointed out that the clinical features were suggestive of Prader-Willi syndrome (176270). This was the first reported male with a de novo MECP2 mutation. Although most de novo MECP2 mutations in female patients with RTT are of paternal origin (Trappe et al., 2001), the example reported by Kleefstra et al. (2002) indicated that de novo mutations can appear on the maternal allele. Laccone et al. (2002) commented that some reported MECP2 mutations, those associated with male phenotypes in particular, may actually be rare genetic variants, and they cautioned against hasty interpretation of the pathogenicity of these nucleotide changes (see, e.g., 300005.0023). By array comparative genomic hybridization (array-CGH), Van Esch et al. (2005) identified a small duplication at Xq28 (300005.0030) in a large family with a severe form of mental retardation associated with progressive spasticity. Screening by real-time quantification of 17 additional patients with mental retardation who had similar phenotypes revealed 3 more duplications. The duplications in the 4 patients varied in size from 0.4 to 0.8 Mb and harbored several genes, which, for each duplication, included the mental retardation-related genes L1CAM (308840) and MECP2. The proximal breakpoints were located within a 250-kb region centromeric to L1CAM, whereas the distal breakpoints were located in a 300-kb interval telomeric of MECP2. The size and location of each duplication was different in the 4 patients. The duplications segregated with the disease in the families, and asymptomatic carrier females showed complete skewing of X inactivation. Comparison of the clinical features in these patients and in a previously reported patient enabled refinement of the genotype-phenotype correlation and strongly suggested that increased dosage of MECP2 results in the mental retardation phenotype. The findings demonstrated that, in humans, not only impaired or abolished gene function but also increased MECP2 dosage causes a distinct phenotype. Duplication of the MECP2 region occurs frequently in male patients with a severe form of mental retardation, which justifies quantitative screening of MECP2 in this group of patients. In a retrospective analysis of families with MRX16 reported by Yntema et al. (2002) and Couvert et al. (2001), Gomot et al. (2003) found that some affected males demonstrated clinical features suggestive of Rett syndrome, including language regression, stereotypies, and spasticity. Carrier females were unaffected, even though some did not show skewed X inactivation. Gomot et al. (2003) suggested that males with MECP2 mutations cluster in 3 overlapping phenotypic groups: a severe lethal form in males born to mildly symptomatic female carriers with mutations that cause classic Rett syndrome in females (see, e.g., Villard et al., 2000 and T158M; 300005.0007); a severe nonlethal form characterized by severe encephalopathy (300279) (see, e.g., Meloni et al., 2000 and E406X; 300005.0009); and a nonsyndromic mental retardation form (MRX16) (see, e.g., 300005.0017 and Couvert et al., 2001). In addition, there are rare reports of males with an XXY genotype (see, e.g., Hoffbuhr et al., 2001) or males with somatic mosaicism (see Clayton-Smith et al., 2000 and 300005.0010; Topcu et al., 2002 and 300005.0005) who have milder phenotypes that are similar to Rett syndrome. - Angelman Syndrome Phenotype Watson et al. (2001) identified MECP2 mutations in 5 of 47 patients with a clinical diagnosis of Angelman syndrome and no cytogenetic or molecular abnormality of 15q11-q13. Four of these patients were female and 1 male. By the time of diagnosis, 3 of the patients were showing signs of regression and had features suggestive of Rett syndrome; in the remaining 2, the clinical phenotype was still considered to be Angelman-like. Imessaoudene et al. (2001) identified MECP2 mutations in 6 of 78 patients with possible Angelman syndrome but with normal methylation pattern at the UBE3A locus (601623). Of these, 4 were females with a phenotype consistent with Rett syndrome, one was a female with progressive encephalopathy of neonatal onset, and one was a male with a nonprogressive encephalopathy of neonatal onset. This boy had a gly428-to-ser mutation (300005.0023). - Autism As there is a resemblance between the phenotypes for autism (209850) and Rett syndrome, and 70% of individuals with autism show some degree of mental retardation, some questioned whether specific mutations within the coding region of MECP2 are involved in the etiology of infantile autism. Lam et al. (2000) and Carney et al. (2001) identified mutations in the MECP2 gene in sporadic cases of autism, whereas no mutations were found in a sample of 59 autistic individuals by Vourc'h et al. (2001). Beyer et al. (2002) systematically screened for MECP2 mutations in 152 autistic patients from 134 German families and 50 unrelated patients from the affected relative-pair sample of the International Molecular Genetic Study of Autism Consortium (IMGSAC), and identified 14 sequence variants. Eleven variants were excluded from having an etiologic role as they were either silent mutations, did not cosegregate with autism in the pedigrees of the patients, or represented known polymorphisms. The etiologic relevance of the 3 remaining mutations could not be ruled out, although they were not localized within functional domains of MECP2 and may be rare polymorphisms. Given the large size of the sample, Beyer et al. (2002) concluded that mutations in the coding region of MECP2 do not play a major role in autism susceptibility. Carney et al. (2003) analyzed 69 females clinically diagnosed with autistic disorder for the presence of mutations in the MECP2 gene. Two autistic disorder females were found to have de novo mutations in the MECP2 gene, one a 41-bp deletion beginning at nucleotide 1157 (300005.0012), the other an arg294-to-ter mutation (300005.0011), which is one of the most common RTT mutations in MECP2. - Effects of Mutations on Protein Function Dragich et al. (2000) reviewed the structure, function, and effect of mutations on the activity of MECP2. By Southwestern and gel shift binding analyses of MECP2 proteins with RTT-causing mutations in conserved residues of the MBD, Ballestar et al. (2000) determined that arg106-to-trp (300005.0008), arg133- to-cys (300005.0001), and phe155-to-ser (300005.0002) had dramatically reduced (100-fold) capacities to bind mono- and polymethylated DNA compared with wildtype MECP2. Another mutation, thr158-to-met (T158M; 300005.0007), which occurs at a nonconserved MBD residue near the C-terminal side of the MBD, bound methylated DNA only 2-fold less well than wildtype. Ballestar et al. (2000) noted that T158M is one of the most common mutations in RTT patients. Although the T158 residue is located in the MBD, the authors suggested that it may have other roles related to the function of MECP2, possibly involving interactions with the TRD. Yusufzai and Wolffe (2000) studied the consequences of MECP2 mutations on the ability of MECP2 protein to bind specifically to methylated DNA and its transcription repression capabilities in Xenopus oocytes. Yusufzai and Wolffe (2000) found that all missense mutations within the methyl-binding domain impaired selectivity for methylated DNA, and that all nonsense mutations that truncate all or some of the transcriptional repression domain affected the ability to repress transcription and had decreased levels of stability in vivo. Two missense mutations, one in the TRD (arg306-to-cys) and one in the C terminus (glu397-to-lys), had no noticeable effects on MECP2 function. Wan et al. (2001) examined mutant MECP2 expression and global histone acetylation levels in clonal cell cultures from a female RTT patient with one mutant allele on the active X chromosome, as well as in cells from a male hemizygous for a 1-bp deletion mutation (300005.0003). Both mutant alleles generated stable RNA transcripts, but no intact MECP2 protein was detected by Western blot analysis. Western blot analysis further revealed that histone H4, but not H3, was hyperacetylated, specifically at lysine-16. The authors hypothesized that subsequent overexpression of MECP2 target genes may play a role in the pathogenesis of RTT. LaSalle et al. (2001) quantitated the level and distribution of wildtype and mutant MECP2 protein in situ by immunofluorescence and laser scanning cytometry of brain biopsies and tissue arrays. Cellular heterogeneity in MECP2 expression level was observed in normal brain with a subpopulation of cells exhibiting high expression and the remainder exhibiting low expression. MECP2 expression was significantly higher in CNS compared with non-CNS tissues; MECP2 neurons exhibiting high expression were more numerous in layer IV of the cerebrum, and MECP2 neurons exhibiting low expression were more numerous in the granular layer of the cerebellum. MECP2 mutant-expressing cells were randomly localized in Rett cerebrum and cerebellum and showed normal MECP2 expression with N-terminal-specific anti-MECP2. The authors suggested that mutations in the MECP2 gene in RTT are only manifested in cells highly expressing in the MECP2 protein. Shahbazian and Zoghbi (2002) reviewed the manner in which the linking of epigenetics and neuronal function is revealed by studies of the MECP2 gene in Rett syndrome. Originally thought to be a protein that functions as a global transcriptional repressor, MECP2 is actually specialized for a function in neurons of the CNS. Mouse models reproduce virtually every aspect of RTT, including highly specialized hand-wringing behaviors, which suggests that the pathways leading from dysfunctional MECP2 to each of these features are conserved between humans and mice. Given that, in humans, the phenotypic outcome of MECP2 truncation mutations depends on the position of the truncation, different regions of the protein may interact with particular proteins or complexes. Balmer et al. (2002) performed single cell cloning of T lymphocytes from 4 RTT patients with MECP2 mutations to isolate cells expressing mutant MECP2. Mutant-expressing clones were present at a significantly lower frequency (P less than 0.0001) than wildtype clones. These results demonstrated that although MECP2 is not essential for lymphocyte growth, expression of the MECP2 mutation causes a growth disadvantage in cultured clonal T cells by reducing the response to mitogenic stimulation. Mutant MECP2 was expressed at normal transcript and protein levels, and exhibited no significant effect on acetylated histones or methyl-binding protein-3 (MBD3; 603573) levels. Examination of the expression of 5 imprinted genes suggested that MECP2 does not have an essential role in the silencing of these genes. Kudo et al. (2002) noted that 2 MECP2 mutations, A140V (300005.0015) and E137G (300005.0017), had been found in male patients with nonspecific X-linked mental retardation. Using mouse L929 cells, Kudo et al. (2002) found that expression of these mutant proteins showed clear focal heterochromatin staining patterns indistinguishable from that of wildtype protein, indicating that the 2 mutants retained their ability to bind methyl-CpG. Another mutant, R106W (300005.0008), which had been identified in Rett syndrome, had impaired heterochromatin staining. Using a Drosophila cell line, the authors showed that the A140V mutant retained transcriptional repression activity, whereas the Rett mutant R106W did not. The E137G mutant had impaired transcriptional repression activity. Kudo et al. (2002) concluded that the A140V and E137G Mecp2 mutants exhibited mild impairment of protein function compared to the mutants identified in Rett syndrome. GENOTYPE/PHENOTYPE CORRELATIONS Weaving et al. (2003) reported a large MECP2 screening project in patients diagnosed with Rett syndrome. Composite phenotype severity scores did not correlate with mutation type, domain affected, or X inactivation. Other correlations, including head circumference, height, presence of speech, and age at development of hand stereotypies, suggested that truncating mutations and mutations affecting the MBD tend to lead to a more severe phenotype. Skewed X inactivation was found in 31 (43%) of 72 patients tested, primarily in those with truncating mutations and mutations affecting the MBD. Weaving et al. (2003) concluded that it is likely that X inactivation modulates the phenotype in RTT. In a study of genotype/phenotype correlations, Schanen et al. (2004) analyzed 85 Rett syndrome patients with mutation in the MECP2 gene. Sixty-five (76%) carried 1 of the 8 common mutations. Patients with missense mutations had lower total severity scores and better language performance than those with nonsense mutations. No difference was noted between severity scores for mutations in the MBD and the TRD. However, patients with missense mutations in TRD had the best overall scores and better preservation of head growth and language skills. Analysis of specific mutation groups demonstrated a striking difference for patients with the R306C mutation (300005.0016), including better overall score, later regression, and better language with less motor impairment. Indeed, these patients as a group accounted for the differences in overall scores between the missense and nonsense groups. ANIMAL MODEL Willard and Hendrich (1999) pointed out that the finding that MECP2 is mutated in Rett syndrome fits well with what is known about Mecp2 deficiency in mice (Tate et al., 1996). Male mouse embryonic stem (ES) cells in which Mecp2 is disrupted cannot support development, consistent with the possible male lethality of RTT. In contrast, chimeric mice, in which a small proportion of cells are derived from Mecp2-deficient ES cells, are viable. These animals might provide a model for RTT, as female RTT patients are also mosaic for MECP2-expressing and MECP2-deficient cells because of random X-chromosome inactivation. They also pointed out that Rett syndrome is one of a number of human diseases involving abnormal chromatin assembly or remodeling, with consequent epigenetic effects on expression of one or more genes that are themselves not mutated. Other examples include the imprinting defects and the discovery of a defect in phosphorylation of histone H3 by ribosomal protein S6 kinase (RPS6KA3; 300075) in Coffin-Lowry syndrome (303600). Chen et al. (2001) generated mice deficient in MECP2. Contrary to the conclusion of Tate et al. (1996), Chen et al. (2001) demonstrated that disruption of Mecp2 does not lead to embryonic lethality. Mecp2-null mice were normal until 5 weeks of age, when they began to develop disease, leading to death between 6 and 12 weeks. The initial manifestations of abnormal behavior included nervousness, body trembling, pila erection, and occasional hard respiration at 5 weeks of age. A significant portion of mutant mice became overweight, and most exhibited signs of physical deterioration by 8 weeks of age. At late stages of the disease, mutants were hypoactive, trembled when handled, and often began to lose weight. Most mutants died at approximately 10 weeks of age. Heterozygous mutant females seemed normal for the first 4 months but began to show symptoms such as weight gain, reduced activity, and ataxic gait at a later age. Autopsy showed a substantial reduction in both brain weight and neuronal cell size but no obvious structural defects or signs of neurodegeneration. Brain-specific deletion of Mecp2 at embryonic day 12 resulted in a phenotype identical to that of the null mutation, indicating that the phenotype is caused by Mecp2 deficiency in the central nervous system (CNS) rather than in peripheral tissues. Deletion of Mecp2 in postnatal CNS neurons led to a similar neuronal phenotype, although at a later age. Chen et al. (2001) concluded that the role of MECP2 is not restricted to the immature brain but becomes critical in mature neurons. MECP2 deficiency in these neurons is sufficient to cause neuronal dysfunction with symptomatic manifestation similar to Rett syndrome. Using similar methods, Guy et al. (2001) replaced exons 3 and 4 of MECP2. They also found that mice homozygous or hemizygous for the replacement were viable and fertile. Guy et al. (2001) found that body weight varied depending upon genetic background. The Mecp2-null mutation on a C57BL/6 background gave rise to animals that were substantially underweight from 4 weeks of age with full penetrance. After crossing to a 129 strain, F1 animals showed a reverse effect. Instead of losing weight, male Mecp2-null mice were the same weight as wildtype littermates until 8 weeks, when survivors became significantly heavier than sibs with an obvious increase in deposited fat. Other aspects of the phenotype including behavioral defects were not affected by altered genetic background. Mecp2-null male and female mice showed no initial phenotype, but both developed a stiff uncoordinated gait and reduced spontaneous movement between 3 and 8 weeks of age. Most animals subsequently developed hindlimb clasping and irregular breathing. Pathologic analysis of symptomatic animals revealed no obvious histologic abnormalities in a range of organs. In particular, the brain showed no unusual features of cortical lamination, ectopias, or other abnormalities. Variable progression of symptoms led ultimately to rapid weight loss and death at approximately 54 days. After several months heterozygous female mice also showed behavioral symptoms. The overlapping delay before symptom onset in humans and mice, despite the profoundly different rates of development, raises the possibility that stability of brain function, not brain development per se, is compromised by the absence of MECP2. Shahbazian et al. (2002) generated mice expressing a truncated Mecp2 protein similar to those found in RTT. They showed that although the truncated Mecp2 protein in these mice localized normally to heterochromatic domains in vivo, histone H3 (142780) was hyperacetylated. Shahbazian et al. (2002) suggested that the elevated levels of histone H3 acetylation provided in vivo evidence for the role of MECP2 in the modification of chromatin architecture. In transgenic female mice heterozygous for a truncating Mecp2 mutation, Young and Zoghbi (2004) found that X-chromosome inactivation (XCI) patterns were unbalanced in more than 60% of the animals, favoring expression of the wildtype allele. None of the animals had nonrandom XCI favoring the mutant allele. Primary neuronal cell cultures from the mutant mice showed selective survival of neurons in which the wildtype X chromosome was active. Phenotypic manifestations, including tremor, grooming, and stereotypic forepaw movements, were highly variable in the mutant female mice. There was a correlation between the pattern of XCI, expressed as the percentage of neurons with the wildtype allele active, and phenotype; significantly fewer abnormal phenotypes were observed when a large percentage of neurons had skewing toward expression of the wildtype X chromosome. Young and Zoghbi (2004) noted that previous reports had suggested that the majority of human patients with Rett syndrome have balanced translocations (Shahbazian et al., 2002), and suggested that this finding may be due to ascertainment bias; there may be females with MECP2 mutations who are asymptomatic or unrecognized due to skewed XCI. By binding to methylated CpG dinucleotide promoter regions, MECP2 acts as a transcriptional repressor; its absence might therefore result in widespread aberrant gene transcription, leading to the phenotype of Rett syndrome. Considering this potentially broad action of MECP2 on expression and the complexity of the brain, especially during development, Matarazzo and Ronnett (2004) approached the consequences of MECP2 deficiency in a mouse model by using a temporal and regional proteomic strategy. They used the olfactory system (olfactory epithelium and bulb) because its attributes make it an excellent developmental model system. They found evidence of temporal and regional proteomic pattern differences between wildtype and Mecp2 deficient mice. These changes in protein expression were segregated into 5 groups based on biologic function: cytoskeleton arrangement, chromatin modeling, energy metabolism, cell signaling, and neuroprotection. By combining the proteomic results with the RNA levels of the identified proteins, the authors showed that protein expression changes are the consequence of differences in mRNA level or posttranslational modifications. Matarazzo and Ronnett (2004) concluded that brain regions and ages must be carefully considered when investigating MECP2 deficiency, and that not only transcription should be taken into account as a source of these changes, but also posttranslational protein modifications. Using quantitative laser scanning cytometry, Braunschweig et al. (2004) showed that Mecp2 -/+ female mice exhibited uniform regional distribution of Mecp2 mutant-expressing cells in brain, but unbalanced X chromosome inactivation in the population, thus favoring expression of the Mecp2 wildtype allele. In addition, the level of Mecp2 expression in Mecp2 wildtype-expressing cells from Mecp2 -/+ mice was significantly lower than those from Mecp2 +/+ age-matched controls. The negative effect of Mecp2 mutation on wildtype Mecp2 expression correlated with the percentage of Mecp2 mutant-expressing cells in the cortex. Similar results were observed in 2 RTT females with identical MECP2 mutations but different X chromosome inactivation ratios. The authors concluded that Mecp2-mutant neurons affect the development of surrounding neurons in a non-cell-autonomous manner, and that environmental influences may affect the level of Mecp2 expression in wildtype neurons. To search for Mecp2 target genes in mouse brain that might be dysregulated in individuals with RTT, Horike et al. (2005) used a modified chromatin immunoprecipitation-based cloning strategy. The strategy was based on the assumption that Mecp2 target genes were located close to the binding sites of Mecp2 in vivo. They identified Dlx5 (600028) as a direct target gene of Mecp2 and found that human DLX5 had lost its maternal-specific imprinted status in lymphoblastoid cells of patients with RTT. They also found that Mecp2-mediated histone modification and formation of a higher-order chromatin-loop structure specifically associated with silent chromatin at the Dlx5-Dlx6 locus. The results of Horike et al. (2005) identified a new role for Mecp2 in chromatin organization and imprinting. Kriaucionis and Bird (2003) reviewed the basic properties of MeCP2 in the context of a mouse model of Rett syndrome.

comment: CLONING Stayton et al. (1994) described the cloning and characterization of a gene, provisionally called X-linked helicase-2 (XH2), located on chromosome Xq13. The gene undergoes X inactivation, contains a 4-kb open reading frame, and encodes a putative NTP-binding nuclear protein homologous to several members of the helicase II superfamily. In situ hybridization studies in the mouse revealed precocious, widespread expression of the murine homolog of XH2 at early stages of embryogenesis, and more restricted expression during late developmental stages and at birth. XH2 shares 6 conserved, collinear domains with other members of the family of proven and putative helicases. In particular, the XH2 protein shows homology with RAD54. Type II helicases have been implicated in nucleotide excision repair and initiation of transcription. Picketts et al. (1996) established the full-length sequence of the ATRX cDNA and predicted the structure of the ATRX protein. Their comparative analysis showed that ATRX is a member of the SNF2-like subgroup of a superfamily of proteins with similar ATPase and helicase domains (see 300012). The N-terminal region contains a nuclear localization signal and antibody studies indicated a nuclear localization of the protein. The C-terminal region is glutamine rich, a common attribute of other transcription factors. In addition, a 15-amino acid segment (the P element) in the C-terminal region shows 35 to 50% similarity to SNF2-like proteins which are involved in gene expression. Villard et al. (1997) determined that the ATRX gene encodes a predicted protein of 2,492 amino acids. Three zinc finger motifs were found within the 5-prime end of the gene. Expression analysis in different tissues identified an alternative splicing event that involves exon 6. One of these alternatively spliced transcripts is expressed predominantly in embryonic tissues. Gibbons et al. (1998) used the N-terminal sequence of ATRX, as identified by Picketts et al. (1996), to identify a cysteine-rich motif, similar to a putative zinc finger domain (cys4-his-cys3), called the PHD finger. PHD motifs span 50 to 80 amino acids and had been identified in more than 40 proteins, many of which are implicated in chromatin-mediated transcriptional control. Picketts et al. (1998) showed that the mouse Atrx gene shows structural features similar to those of the human gene. Two highly conserved and functionally important regions were identified: a potential finger domain at the N terminus and a catalytic domain at the C terminus. Gibbons and Higgs (2000) stated that the XH2 gene encodes at least 2 alternatively spliced mRNA transcripts that differ at the 5-prime ends and give rise to slightly different proteins of 265 and 280 kD, respectively. GENE STRUCTURE Stayton et al. (1994) determined that the genomic length of XH2 is more than 220 kb. Picketts et al. (1996) determined that the XH2 gene contains 36 exons and spans approximately 300 kb. Using a vectorette strategy, Villard et al. (1997) identified and sequenced the intron/exon boundaries of the ATRX gene. MAPPING Stayton et al. (1994) mapped the XH2 gene to chromosome Xq13, between the gene for Menkes disease (MNK; 309400) and DXS56. They showed that the murine homolog maps to the homologous genetic interval between Pgk1 and Xist. GENE FUNCTION Gibbons et al. (1995) showed that mutations in the XH2 gene cause the alpha-thalassemia/mental retardation syndrome (ATR-X; 301040), an X-linked disorder comprising severe psychomotor retardation, characteristic facial features, genital abnormalities, and alpha-thalassemia. XH2 is a member of a subgroup of the helicase superfamily that includes proteins involved in a wide range of cellular functions, including DNA recombination and repair (e.g., ERCC6; 609413) and transcription regulation. Because of the complex ATR-X phenotype, Gibbons et al. (1995) suggested that a mutation in the XH2 gene results in transcriptional downregulation of several genes, including the alpha-globin genes. Picketts et al. (1996) suggested that ATRX is most likely involved in the regulation of gene expression, a known function of helicases. They noted that ATRX downregulates alpha-globin (141800) but not beta-globin (141900). They postulated that this may be due to the fact that alpha- and beta-globin are contained within different chromosomal environments and are regulated differently because of the interaction of regulatory factors and chromatin. The SNF2-like family comprises numerous members involved in a broad range of biologic functions: transcriptional regulation, DNA repair, and chromosome segregation. Since experiments on fibroblasts from ATR-X patients provided no evidence for either a DNA repair defect or abnormal chromosome breakage segregation, Cardoso et al. (1998) suspected that the XNP protein is somehow involved in regulation of gene expression. Genetic and biochemical studies had led to the emerging concept that SNF2-like proteins are components of a large protein complex that may exert its functions by modulating chromatin structure. Cardoso et al. (1998) performed a yeast 2-hybrid analysis with XNP and several human heterochromatin-associated proteins. They found a specific interaction between XNP and the EZH2 (601573) proteins. In light of these observations, they discussed how the XNP protein may regulate gene transcription at the chromatin level. Using indirect immunofluorescence and confocal microscopy, McDowell et al. (1999) showed that ATRX protein is associated with pericentromeric heterochromatin during interphase and mitosis. By coimmunofluorescence, they found that ATRX localizes with a mouse homolog of the Drosophila heterochromatic protein HP1 in vivo, consistent with a previous 2-hybrid screen identifying this interaction. From the analysis of a trap assay for nuclear proteins, McDowell et al. (1999) showed that the localization of ATRX to heterochromatin is encoded by its N-terminal region, which contains a conserved plant homeodomain-like finger and a coiled-coil domain. In addition to its association with heterochromatin, at metaphase ATRX clearly binds to the short arms of human acrocentric chromosomes, where the arrays of ribosomal DNA are located. The unexpected association of a putative transcriptional regulator with highly repetitive DNA provides a potential explanation for the variability in phenotype of patients with identical mutations in the ATRX gene. Berube et al. (2000) demonstrated that the association of the ATRX protein with chromosomes at mitosis is concomitant with phosphorylation and its association with HP1-alpha (604478). The authors proposed a dual role for ATRX, possibly involving gene regulation at interphase as well as chromosomal segregation at mitosis. XY patients with deletions or mutations in the ATRX gene display varying degrees of sex reversal, implicating ATRX in the development of the human testis (Reardon et al., 1995). To explore further the role of ATRX in mammalian sex differentiation, Pask et al. (2000) cloned and characterized the homologous gene in a marsupial. To their surprise, active homologs of ATRX were detected on the marsupial Y as well as the X chromosome. The Y-borne copy (ATRY) displayed testis-specific expression. This, as well as the sex reversal of ATRX patients, suggested that ATRY is involved in testis development in marsupials and may represent an ancestral testis-determining mechanism that predated the evolution of SRY (480000) as the primary mammalian male sex-determining gene. The authors found no evidence for a Y-borne ATRX homolog in mouse or human, implying that this gene has been lost in eutherians and its role supplanted by the evolution of SRY from SOX3 (313430) as the dominant determiner of male differentiation. Gibbons et al. (2003) stated that like other members of the SWI2/SNF2 family of proteins, multiprotein complexes isolated by ATRX antibodies have ATP-dependent nucleosome remodeling and DNA translocase activities in vitro. ATRX is a nuclear protein that localizes to nuclear subcompartments called PML bodies and to pericentromeric heterochromatin, where it interacts with a known component of heterochromatin, HP1. MOLECULAR GENETICS In patients with the ATR-X syndrome (301040), an X-linked disorder comprising severe psychomotor retardation, characteristic facial features, genital abnormalities, and alpha-thalassemia, Gibbons et al. (1995) identified mutations in the XH2 gene (300032.0001-300032.0009). They identified 2 premature in-frame stop mutations, 7 missense mutations, and a small deletion that reduced expression of the gene in ATR-X patients to less than 1% of that of controls. A clue to the presence of mutations in XH2 associated with ATR-X syndrome was the absence of a hybridization signal with an XH2 probe in the patient with the deletion. The 9 other mutations were identified by single-strand conformation polymorphism analysis followed by sequencing. Picketts et al. (1996) screened 52 individuals with ATR-X syndrome and identified 4 novel splicing defects in the ATRX gene. They reported sites of mutation in 27 different cases of ATR-X. Picketts et al. (1996) noted that mutations associated with the severe urogenital abnormalities which may occur in ATR-X have primarily been mutations that lead to severe truncation of the protein with loss of the C-terminal region, which includes both the P element and the polyglutamine tract. In a family with Juberg-Marsidi syndrome (309580), Villard et al. (1996) demonstrated a mutation in the ATRX gene (300032.0011). The findings indicated that X-linked alpha-thalassemia/mental retardation syndrome and Juberg-Marsidi syndrome are the same disorder. Villard et al. (1997) searched for mutations in the 5-prime region of the ATRX gene in ATR-X patients who did not have mutations in the 3-prime region. In 1 patient, they found that part of exon 7 was removed from the XNP transcript as a result of a mutation creating a novel splice site that was substituted for the natural splice site (300032.0013). The new splicing event removed 1 zinc finger motif, suggesting that mutations in both the helicase and zinc finger regions result in disease manifestations. Extending the mutation analysis of the ATRX gene to include the PHD zinc finger region, Gibbons et al. (1998) identified 10 different mutations within a 294-bp segment (see, e.g., 300032.0014; 300032.0015). Family studies confirmed de novo mutations at 4 of these sites. In 15 unrelated individuals, a C-to-T transition at a single CpG dinucleotide, presumably a deamination 'hotspot,' changed arg to cys, which had the potential to disrupt the putative zinc finger. Similarly, 3 mutations affected conserved cys residues, which could coordinate zinc binding in this region. Finally, in 4 unrelated individuals, an identical splice site mutation removed 21 amino acids, which would disrupt the putative zinc finger located upstream of the PHD-like domain. Although the clinical phenotype of particular ATRX mutations was similar, there was a wide range in the perturbation of alpha-globin expression as reflected by the proportion of cells with Hb H inclusions, suggesting that the effect of ATRX protein on gene expression, as for other chromatin-associated regulators, may be modified by other genetic factors. Variation was observed even within the same family. Villard et al. (1999) reported mutation analysis of the XNP gene using direct sequencing of PCR products derived from primers amplifying the 300-bp zinc finger coding region spanning exons 7, 8, and 9. In 21 mentally retarded male patients with facial appearance typical of ATR-X, but not necessarily having urogenital abnormalities or hemoglobin H inclusions, 6 mutations (28%) were detected. Villard et al. (1999) concluded that this method was suitable for screening individuals in this population. Bachoo and Gibbons (1999) identified 2 women who were each mosaic for an ATRX mutation. One of them, whose mutation was undetectable in peripheral blood and buccal cells, had 2 affected sons and was therefore presumed to be a germline mosaic. In the other woman, the ATRX mutation was weakly detectable in the peripheral blood, but only 1 of her 3 children who shared the disease-associated haplotype carried the mutation. Therefore, the authors concluded that she represented a gonosomal mosaic. These cases provided the first molecular evidence for the occurrence of postzygotic mutations in ATR-X syndrome. Gibbons et al. (2000) demonstrated that mutations in the ATRX gene give rise to changes in the methylation pattern of several highly repeated sequences, including the rDNA arrays, a Y-specific satellite, and subtelomeric repeats. Using methylation-sensitive restriction endonucleases, they noted differences in the pattern of rDNA methylation by comparing genomic DNA from EBV-transformed B cells or the peripheral blood of normal individuals with that from patients with ATRX syndrome. In normal individuals, approximately 20% of rDNA repeats were methylated within most CpG-rich regions. In ATRX patients, rDNA genes were substantially unmethylated. These differences were present in a variety of tissues from the fetal stage of development onwards. The Y-specific repeat DYZ2 makes up 10 to 20% of the Y chromosome, distributed along the entire heterochromatic band Yq12. Gibbons et al. (2000) discovered that approximately 6% of DYZ2 repeats were unmethylated on the Y chromosomes in the peripheral blood of normal individuals, but almost all were methylated in ATRX patients. These results differed from those identified in the rDNA repeats, suggesting that the effect of ATRX mutations on Y-chromosome repeats is different from their effect on rDNA repeats. Gibbons et al. (2000) concluded that their findings provide a potential link between the processes of chromatin remodeling, DNA methylation, and gene expression in mammalian development. In a study of 8 unrelated Japanese families, Wada et al. (2000) found 7 missense mutations, including 6 novel mutations, as the cause of the ATR-X syndrome. One mutation, arg246-to-cys (300032.0018), was found in 2 unrelated patients. All mutations were located either in the N-terminal region corresponding to the putative zinc finger domain or in the C-terminal region corresponding to the helicase domain. The clinical manifestations were the same with mutations of either group, suggesting that the putative zinc finger and helicase domains have similar functional significance for the ATRX gene. Using a broad range denaturing gel gradient electrophoresis (DGGE) method for single-step mutation scanning of the entire open reading frame and canonical splice sites of the ATRX gene, Borgione et al. (2003) identified 5 novel sequence changes: 4 missense mutations and 1 polymorphism. Rarely, alpha-thalassemia occurs as an acquired abnormality in individuals with various types of multilineage myelodysplasia, the so-called ATMDS syndrome (300448) (Weatherall et al., 1978; Higgs et al., 1983). Gibbons et al. (2003) stated that 71 individuals with the ATMDS syndrome had been identified, of whom 62 (87%) were males who had a de novo, acquired form of alpha-thalassemia with hypochromic microcytic anemia. In these individuals, a reduction in alpha-globin expression leads to an excess of beta-globin chains, which form an abnormal hemoglobin (HbH, or beta-4) that is readily detectable in peripheral blood. In the most severely affected individuals, alpha-chain synthesis is almost abolished, implying that all 4 alpha genes are downregulated. This degree of alpha-thalassemia would be lethal during development if it resulted from an inherited mutation. No structural abnormalities in cis to the alpha-globin genes had been detected, and the downregulation of alpha-globin appeared to be associated with a trans-acting mutation. ATRX was a plausible candidate for harboring mutations associated with this syndrome. Because of the large size of the gene (300 kb) and the failure of previous direct mutational searches, Gibbons et al. (2003) chose microarray analysis to search for genes whose expression might be perturbed in ATMDS. In purified granulocytes from the peripheral blood they found that ATRX expression was 3 to 4% of that in normal controls. In contrast, there was no significant reduction in ATRX expression in 13 individuals with myelodysplasia syndrome with alpha-thalassemia. Sequence analysis identified a G-to-A mutation in the canonic splice donor site (GT) of intron 1 of ATRX (300032.0020). This mutation was present in granulocytes but absent in DNA from both buccal cells and a lymphoblastoid cell line derived from the patient. The finding suggested that this pleiotropic cofactor is an essential component rather than a mere facilitator of globin gene expression. For many important genes, inherited null mutations are lethal early in development. The only viable manifestations of such mutations in these genes will be seen in diseases associated with acquired somatic mutations. Other examples of this, in addition to ATRX, include mutations of PIGA (311770) in paroxysmal nocturnal hemoglobinuria, and GNAS1 (139320) in McCune-Albright syndrome (174800). GENOTYPE/PHENOTYPE CORRELATIONS In a review article, Gibbons and Higgs (2000) noted that mutations resulting in the loss of the C terminal domain are associated with the most severe urogenital abnormalities. However, at other sites, there is no obvious link between genotype and phenotype, and there is considerable variation in the degree of abnormalities seen in individuals with the same mutation. ANIMAL MODEL Although the ATRX protein is a member of the SWI/SNF family of chromatin remodeling proteins, little is known about the biochemical activity of the ATRX protein or its in vivo function during development. Berube et al. (2002) demonstrated that ATRX is part of a large multiprotein complex similar in size to the SWI/SNF complex. Overexpression of ATRX in transgenic mice was associated with growth retardation, neural tube defects, and a high incidence of embryonic death. Moreover, brains from E10.5 transgenic embryos displayed abnormal growth and organization of the ventricular zone that was highly convoluted in the most severely affected embryos. Transgenic mice that survived to birth exhibited a high incidence of perinatal death as well as seizures, mild craniofacial anomalies, and abnormal behavior. The authors concluded that ATRX dosage is crucial for normal development and organization of the cortex. By immunostaining for Atrx in mouse brain, Berube et al. (2005) found that Atrx expression was nuclear in all cells and coincided with regions of intense DAPI staining, consistent with a heterochromatin colocalization. The temporal pattern of Atrx expression followed the process of neuroprogenitor differentiation. To circumvent early lethality in Atrx-null mice, Berube et al. (2005) developed mice with forebrain-targeted conditional loss of Atrx expression. Targeted loss of Atrx caused widespread hypocellularity in the neocortex and hippocampus and a pronounced reduction in forebrain size. Neuronal 'birthdating' confirmed that fewer neurons reached the superficial cortical layers, despite normal progenitor cell proliferation. The loss of cortical mass resulted from a 12-fold increase in neuronal apoptosis during early stages of corticogenesis in the mutant animals. Cultured cortical progenitor cells isolated from Atrx-null mice underwent enhanced apoptosis upon differentiation. Berube et al. (2005) concluded that Atrx is a critical mediator of cell survival during early neuronal differentiation and that neuronal loss may contribute to the mental retardation observed in ATR-X syndrome patients.

comment: A number sign (#) is used with this entry because of evidence that this disorder is caused by mutation in the transcription factor SOX3 (313430). Hamel et al. (1996) reported a family in which X-linked mental retardation associated with isolated growth hormone deficiency mapped to Xq24-q27.3 by linkage analysis; maximum lod score = 3.26 at theta = 0.0 for DXS294. The males in 3 generations connected through females suffered in varying degrees from mental retardation, isolated growth hormone deficiency, and infantile behavior but without other consistent phenotypic abnormalities. The male patients continued to grow until well into their twenties and reached a height ranging from 135 to 159 cm. Except for one, all female carriers were mentally normal; their adult heights ranged from 159 to 168 cm. Whether the XLMR-IGHD phenotype in these patients was the pleiotropic effect of a single gene or represented a contiguous gene syndrome was uncertain. Raynaud et al. (1998) likewise observed X-linked mental retardation with isolated growth hormone deficiency in a single family and concluded that the disorder mapped to Xq22-q27.1 in that instance. Both of these regional assignments overlap with that of agammaglobulinemia with isolated growth hormone deficiency (307200) which has been assigned to Xq21.33. In the 3-generation family reported by Raynaud et al. (1998), there were 3 living affected males and 5 symptomatic females with short stature, microcephaly, and particular facial traits, i.e., high, curved forehead, midface hypoplasia, and concave nasal bridge with nasal end of normal size. X-linked panhypopituitarism (312000) maps to Xq25-q26. Laumonnier et al. (2002) performed mutation analyses in families with X-linked mental retardation where the causative locus mapped to Xq26-q27. In a large family in which affected individuals had mental retardation and growth hormone deficiency, they found a mutation in the SOX3 gene (313430). The mutation resulted in an in-frame duplication of 33 bp encoding for 11 alanines in a polyalanine tract of the SOX3 gene.

comment: For background information on thyroid hormone receptor-associated proteins (TRAPs), see 300182. CLONING Nagase et al. (1996) cloned a cDNA, which they referred to as KIAA0192, from the human cell line KG-1. They found that the cDNA contains stretches of CAG (gln) repeats and encodes a 2,124-amino acid protein. Using a HeLa cell line, Ito et al. (1999) cloned the same gene, TRAP230, which encodes the 230-kD subunit of the TRAP complex. The sequence of the TRAP230 protein was found in 2 other reports of partial sequences: CAG H45 (Margolis et al., 1997), and an opposite paired (OPA)-containing protein called HOPA by Philibert et al. (1998) located on chromosome Xq13. TRAP230 also contains 2 overlapping ligand-dependent nuclear hormone receptor signature recognition motifs (LXXLL motifs) near the N terminus and a highly glutamine-rich C-terminal region that results from the CAG trinucleotide repeats. Sequence comparisons revealed that TRAP230 also has significant homology with a hypothetical C. elegans protein (CEF47A4). This protein has a regional identity of 23% and similarity of 40% with TRAP230 and also possesses a characteristic glutamine-rich sequence near the C terminus. Northern blot analysis of multiple human tissues showed that the TRAP230 gene is ubiquitously expressed as an approximately 7.6-kb transcript. By Northern blot analysis of the HOPA gene transcript and its murine ortholog, Mopa1, Philibert et al. (1999) demonstrated that only 1 transcript is expressed throughout the central nervous system and other tissues, and that the transcript is highly expressed during early fetal development. The presence of an OPA (opposite paired) element strongly suggested that HOPA is under tissue- or developmental-specific control (Grabowski et al., 1991). GENE FUNCTION By yeast 2-hybrid analysis of a human embryo cDNA expression library, Zhou et al. (2002) found that the transcription activation domain of SOX9 (608160) interacted with the proline-, glutamine-, and leucine-rich (PQL) domain of TRAP230. In vitro and in vivo assays confirmed that the proteins interact endogenously and associate with several other TRAP complex proteins in HeLa cell nuclear lysates. SOX9 and TRAP230 colocalized in nuclei of cultured human embryo chondrocytes. The isolated PQL domain of TRAP230 acted as a dominant-negative inhibitor of SOX9 activity. GENE STRUCTURE Philibert et al. (1999) sequenced the HOPA gene and found that it is 25 kb long and contains 44 exons. A promoter scan analysis demonstrated 2 possible transcription initiation sites without TATA boxes upstream from the putative translation initiation start site. MAPPING By use of human/rodent hybrid cell lines, Nagase et al. (1996) mapped the KIAA0192 gene to the X chromosome. MOLECULAR GENETICS Philibert et al. (1998) reported a strong association of a variant polymorphism, a 12-bp duplication (CAGCAACACCAG), in the HOPA gene with an X-linked mental retardation/hypothyroidism syndrome in several independent cohorts. Friez et al. (2000) concluded that the 12-bp duplication in the HOPA gene is not associated with mental retardation. They determined the incidence of the dodecamer duplication in cohorts of non-fragile X males with mental retardation from 3 countries, cohorts of fragile X males from 2 countries, 43 probands from families with X-linked mental retardation, and control cohorts from 3 countries. The duplication was found in 3.6 to 4.0% of male patients from 2 non-fragile X groups, in 1.2% from another non-fragile X group, but in no male patients from families with X-linked mental retardation. The dodecamer duplication was also found in several white males with fragile X syndrome from France (5%) and South Africa (22.2%). Additionally, the duplication was found in 1.5% of South Carolinian newborn males, 2.5% of South Carolinian male college students, 5% of Italian male controls, and 4.5% of white South African controls. The duplication appeared to be rare in the black South African population. The incidence of the duplication was not significantly different between any of the groups in the study. A study by Beyer et al. (2002) also failed to sustain the hypothesis that the HOPA gene is a significant susceptibility factor for infantile autism and mental retardation. The 12-bp duplication in the HOPA gene appeared to function as a benign polymorphism.

comment: DESCRIPTION Connexins are membrane-spanning proteins that assemble to form gap junction channels that facilitate the transfer of ions and small molecules between cells (Bergoffen et al., 1993). For a general discussion of connexin proteins, see GJB2 (121011). CLONING Kumar and Gilula (1986) isolated the human CX32 gene from a human liver cDNA library. By Northern blot analysis, Bergoffen et al. (1993) showed CX32 expression in liver and peripheral nerve. MAPPING Willecke et al. (1990) used a rat cDNA probe in Southern analysis of a panel of human-mouse somatic cell hybrids to map CX32 to Xp11-q13. Through analysis of somatic cell hybrids by PCR and hybridization, Fishman et al. (1991) assigned the GJA1 gene (121014) to chromosome 6 and the GJB1 gene to Xp11-q22. Structural comparisons of these genes indicated that they probably arose from a common progenitor gene. Because of a critical function, the connexins may have evolved early and have remained relatively conserved despite their disparate locations. Using a series of somatic cell hybrid mapping panels and a rat GJB1 probe, Corcos et al. (1992) mapped the CX32 gene to proximal Xq13.1, in interval 8, as described by Lafreniere et al. (1991). By somatic cell hybrids, Hsieh et al. (1991) mapped GJB1 to Xcen-q22 and mapped the corresponding gene to the X chromosome in the mouse. Raimondi et al. (1992) refined the assignment to Xq13 by in situ hybridization. GENE FUNCTION Bergoffen et al. (1993) found CX32 expression in myelinated peripheral nerve at the nodes of Ranvier and Schmidt-Lanterman incisures. CX32 may form intracellular gap junctions that connect to the folds of Schwann cell cytoplasm, allowing the transfer of nutrients, ions, and molecules to the innermost myelin layers. Scherer et al. (1995) demonstrated that CX32 is normally found in the paranodal myelin loops and Schmidt-Lanterman incisures of myelinating Schwann cells in the peripheral nervous system, as well as in oligodendrocytes and their processes, but not in compact myelin of the central nervous system. Kumar and Gilula (1996) gave a general review of the gap junction communication channel. Beta-1 connexin is widely expressed in many tissues, including liver. Bondurand et al. (2001) showed that the transcription modulator SOX10 (602229), in synergy with EGR2 (129010), strongly activates CX32 expression in vitro by directly binding to its promoter. In agreement with this finding, SOX10 and EGR2 mutants identified in patients with peripheral myelin defects failed to transactivate the CX32 promoter. MOLECULAR GENETICS By direct sequencing, Bergoffen et al. (1993) identified 7 different mutations in the CX32 gene (see, e.g., 304040.0001-304040.0003) in affected persons from 8 families with X-linked Charcot-Marie-Tooth disease (CMTX; 302800). Bone et al. (1995) described sequence analysis from 19 unrelated patients with X-linked Charcot-Marie-Tooth disease, detecting 6 novel mutations and 3 previously reported mutations (see, e.g., 304040.0003-304040.0011). Analysis of the distribution of these mutations as well as those previously reported suggested to the authors that virtually all regions of connexin 32 are important in its function. Ionasescu et al. (1996) studied 27 families with X-linked Charcot-Marie-Tooth neuropathy. Mutations in the coding region of the CX32 gene were found in 22 families. These mutations included 4 nonsense mutations, 8 missense mutations, 2 medium-sized deletions, and 1 insertion. Most missense mutations showed a mild clinical phenotype (5 of 8), whereas all nonsense mutations, the larger of the 2 deletions, and the insertion that produced frameshifts showed severe phenotypes. No point mutations in the CX32 gene coding region were found in 5 CMTX1 families with mild clinical phenotype. In 3 of these families, positive genetic linkage with the markers of the Xq13.1 region were found; the genetic linkage of the remaining 2 families could not be evaluated because of their small size. Omori et al. (1996) studied 4 known mutations in the connexin-32 gene: lys60 to phe, a mutation in a highly conserved cysteine residue; val139 to met (304040.0003), located in the transmembrane region; arg215 to trp, located in the cytoplasmic tail; and ala220 to ter (304040.0005), also located in the cytoplasmic tail. Since HeLa cells do not show detectable levels of gap junction intercellular communication (GJIC) or expression of any connexins, they tested the functional effects of transfecting mutant genes in HeLa cultures. The first 3 mutations were unable to restore GJIC in transfected HeLa cells (although their gene products were detectable), in contrast to normal GJIC detected with the last mutation. In addition, the dominant-negative effect was tested in doubly transfected HeLa cells and the investigators found that low expression of the mutant CX32 gene had a relatively significant effect on diminishing GJIC. Omori et al. (1996) therefore concluded that certain mutants form nonfunctional chimeric connexins with wildtype connexins. Nelis et al. (1997) described 5 new mutations in the CX32 gene. Janssen et al. (1997) performed SSCP analysis of the CX32 gene in 121 patients selected from the larger group of 443 patients on the basis of linkage to Xq13.1, absence of the 17p12 duplication or deletion, and absence of point mutations in PMP22 and P0. They found 5 new mutations and 3 mutations previously described in other unrelated families. In 35 unrelated CMTX patients without the 17p11.2 duplication but with median nerve conduction between 30 and 40 m/s, Rouger et al. (1997) screened for a CX32 mutation. A total of 14 mutations were found, 5 of which had not previously been reported. All but 1 of the mutations were detected by SSCP. Mutations causing CMTX have been found mostly in exon 2 of the gene. Latour et al. (1997) identified a total of 19 separate mutations in the CX32 gene as the cause of CMTX in 21 French families. Ainsworth et al. (1998) reported a family in which affected members with CMTX had complete deletion of the GJB1 gene with complete absence of the Cx32 gene product. The clinical phenotype in the affected individuals in this kindred did not appear to differ greatly from the phenotype observed in other individuals with missense, nonsense, or frameshift mutations in the gene. This would appear to make a dominant-negative effect of the mutation unlikely. Ikegami et al. (1998) stated that more than 130 different mutations of the GJB1 gene, including coding and noncoding regions, had been reported in patients with X-linked CMT. In studies of 49 Japanese families with CMT1 they found 5 mutations of the GJB1 gene; 4 of which had not previously been reported. Nelis et al. (1999) identified 163 distinct mutations in the coding region of the CX32 gene in 268 unrelated patients with hereditary peripheral neuropathy. Of these mutations, 125 were missense mutations, 1 a double missense mutation, 1 a missense mutation combined with a 1-amino acid deletion, 12 nonsense mutations, 17 frameshift mutations, and 6 in-frame deletions and insertions. Further, in 1 case a complex rearrangement in the coding region of CX32 was found. Most missense mutations showed a mild clinical phenotype, whereas all nonsense mutations and frameshift deletion/insertions showed severe phenotypes. Forty-four percent of the codons were mutated in more than 1 patient. At codon 22, 4 distinct mutations were identified in 20 unrelated patients. In 2 X-linked families not showing mutations in the coding region of CX32, mutations in the noncoding region were identified by Ionasescu et al. (1996). In addition to the 163 mutations tabulated for the CX32 gene in patients with hereditary peripheral neuropathy, Nelis et al. (1999) identified 58 mutations in the MPZ gene (159440) and 27 mutations in the PMP22 gene (601097). GJB1 is expressed in both the peripheral and the central nervous system. In consequence, it is not surprising that patients with CMTX1 and specific GJB1 mutations have both peripheral neuropathy and a mild or transient brain disorder (Paulson et al., 2002; Hanemann et al., 2003; Takashima et al., 2003).

comment: Peden (1960) presented a family that showed neonatal true idiopathic hypoparathyroidism. She suggested that most familial cases of early onset are of the X-linked type. The autosomal variety (146200) has a later onset. No affected males reproduced in Peden's family and probably not in others of the X-linked type. Buchs (1957) reported 3 affected brothers who presented with neonatal tetany. Although maternal hyperparathyroidism with fetal parathyroid suppression was not excluded, it is unlikely because subsequent children were normal. Whyte and Weldon (1981) performed extensive studies of a second kindred from Missouri (where Peden's family also lived). No ancestor common to the 2 kindreds could be identified. Tracing ancestry in X-linked traits is always more difficult than for autosomal traits because of the change in patronym that is likely to occur with each generation. Whyte et al. (1986) reported the autopsy findings in a member of the family of Peden (1960) who had died as a teenager after an automobile crash. A careful search for parathyroid tissue was made. Dissection of the thyroid gland and tissue from elsewhere in the neck, including between the trachea and esophagus and in the retroesophageal space, and histologic study of the soft tissue from these areas showed no parathyroid tissue whatever; thus, the pathology appears to be agenesis of the parathyroid glands. The patient was receiving phenobarbital and diphenylhydantoin for treatment of seizures as well as calcium supplements and vitamin D. Teebi et al. (1992) reported a Bedouin family with 4 affected male sibs including a set of triplets. The mother had a brother who died in early infancy of unknown causes. In the family of Whyte and Weldon (1981), Thakker et al. (1988, 1989) established linkage with a RFLP located at Xq26-q27. The locus was shown to be distal to the factor IX locus. Linkage was demonstrated with an MspI-derived RFLP for probe 4D.8 (lod = 3.82 at theta = 0.05); this marker is distal to the HYPX locus. Zucchi et al. (1996) reported a YAC/STS map from the distal portion of Xq and suggested that the locus for X-linked hypoparathyroidism is in a segment 3 Mb telomeric to the factor IX locus (306900). Trump et al. (1998) performed further linkage analysis and suggested that the HYPX locus lies within a 1.5-Mb interval flanked centromerically by marker F9 and telomerically by DXS984. Despite first being described in 1960, X-linked hypoparathyroidism had up to 1996 been reported in only the 2 seemingly unrelated Missouri kindreds (Mumm et al., 1997). Despite genealogic studies of 5 generations, no common ancestor had been identified. Both kindreds lived in eastern Missouri and were known to have migrated there from Kentucky in the 1880s. To investigate the possibility of relatedness, Mumm et al. (1997) compared the DNA sequence of the mitochondrial D-loop among several individuals in both kindreds. The mtDNA sequence was identical among affected males and their maternal lineage for individuals in both kindreds. Conversely, the mtDNA sequence of the fathers of the affected males differed from that of the maternal lineage at 3 to 6 positions. These results demonstrated that the 2 kindreds exhibiting X-linked recessive hypoparathyroidism are indeed related and that an identical gene defect is responsible for the disease. Mumm et al. (1997) suggested that this approach may be important in investigating common ancestry in other X-linked disorders. X-linked recessive hypoparathyroidism was mapped to the 906-kb region on Xq27 that contains 3 genes: ATP11C (300516), U7snRNA, and SOX3 (313430) (Nesbit et al., 2004). Sequence analyses of these 3 genes revealed no abnormalities. Nesbit et al., 2004 raised the possibility that other genomic abnormalities such as duplications or translocations, which could cause altered gene function (Kleinjan and van Heyningen, 2005), may underlie the etiology of X-linked recessive HPT. In studies in the affected members of the Missouri family originally reported by Peden (1960), Bowl et al. (2005) undertook a detailed characterization of the genomic region containing the X-linked recessive HPT locus by combined analysis of single-nucleotide polymorphisms and sequence-tagged sites. This identified a 23- to 25-kb deletion, which did not contain genes. However, DNA fiber-FISH and pulsed-field gel electrophoresis revealed an approximately 340-kb insertion that replaced the deleted fragment. Use of flow-sorted X chromosome-specific libraries and DNA sequence analyses revealed that the telomeric and centromeric breakpoints on X were, respectively, approximately 67 kb downstream of SOX3 and within a repetitive sequence. Use of a monochromosomal somatic cell hybrid panel and metaphase-FISH mapping demonstrated that the insertion originated from 2p25 and contained a segment of the SNTG2 gene (608715) that lacked an open reading frame. However, the deletion-insertion, which represents a novel abnormality causing hypoparathyroidism, could result in a position effect on SOX3 expression. Indeed, Sox3 expression was demonstrated, by in situ hybridization, in the developing parathyroid tissue of mouse embryos between 10.5 and 15.5 days postcoitum. Thus, the results indicated a likely role for SOX3 in the embryonic development of the parathyroid glands.

comment: Severe, bilateral visual defects are associated with congenital nystagmus, which is characterized by binocular spontaneous oscillations. Congenital nystagmus predominantly occurs secondary to the genetic ocular diseases such as albinism, achromatopsia, and Leber congenital amaurosis. It may also develop in the setting of bilateral congenital cataracts, in which case early cataract removal may result in improvement or prevention of the nystagmus. Stayte et al. (1993) found nystagmus in 1 per 1,000 children in a cohort in England followed from birth through the age of 5 years. In contrast to nystagmus that arises as a result of aberrant visual stimulation, nystagmus may also occur in the absence of any apparent ocular disease. In these cases, congenital nystagmus is thought to represent abnormal development of those ocular motor areas of the brain that control fixation. As these patients may have normal visual acuity, it is presumed that the nystagmus represents a primary defect in the parts of the brain responsible for ocular motor control; thus the disorder has been termed congenital motor nystagmus. In addition to X-linked congenital motor nystagmus, autosomal recessive (257400) and autosomal dominant (164100) forms have been described. Nystagmus is associated with at least 3 X-linked disorders: Nettleship-Falls ocular albinism (OA1; 300500), which maps to Xp22.3; complete congenital stationary night blindness (CSNB1; 310500), which maps to Xp11.3; and blue-cone monochromatism (CBBM; 303700), which maps to Xq28. Waardenburg (1962) felt there was no reason to separate an X-linked recessive from an X-linked dominant form as some have attempted. In some families the disorder is recessive in one line and dominant in another (Hemmes, 1924; Waardenburg et al., 1961). The explanation could be that the mutation is identical but that a series of 'wildtype' isoalleles have different effects on penetrance of the mutation in the heterozygous female. Gutmann et al. (1991) reported a 5-generation family in which a woman in the second generation with 46,XX/45,X Turner syndrome was affected. She had 2 normal children: a daughter who proved herself to be a carrier and an affected son. X-linked congenital nystagmus is associated with head oscillations. Gutmann et al. (1991) found that magnetic resonance images of the brain of affected individuals were normal. Berry and Docherty (1992) suggested that the mosaicism was likely to be simply that normally associated with increasing age. However, Gutmann et al. (1992) responded with the rebuttal that the percentage of 45,X cells was significantly different from that in females of comparable age. Kerrison et al. (1999) studied 3 families with congenital motor nystagmus inherited in an X-linked, irregularly dominant pattern. The penetrance among obligate female carriers was 54%. Evaluation of markers in the region of the genes for OA1, CSNB1, and CBBM revealed no evidence of linkage, supporting the hypothesis that X-linked congenital motor nystagmus represents a distinct entity. Linkage analysis showed linkage to Xq26-q27. Assessment of haplotypes and multipoint linkage analysis, which gave a maximum lod score of 10.79 with the 1-lod-unit support interval spanning approximately 7 cM, placed the gene in a region between 2 specific markers. Evaluation of candidate genes SOX3 (313430), which maps to Xq26-q27, and CDR1 (302650), which maps to Xq27.1-q27.2, revealed no mutations in affected male subjects. In a single large French family including 12 individuals with idiopathic congenital nystagmus over 4 generations, Cabot et al. (1999) mapped the gene for X-linked dominant congenital nystagmus to the short arm of the X chromosome by showing close linkage of the locus (NYS1) to polymorphic markers on Xp11.4-p11.3 (maximum lod = 3.20 with DXS993). The reason for the inconsistency with the mapping reported by Kerrison et al. (1999) is unclear. It is possible that there are 2 loci for idiopathic congenital nystagmus on the X chromosome. In the French family studied by Cabot et al. (1999), the Xq26-q28 region was totally excluded by linkage analysis using highly polymorphic markers spanning this region (Kaplan, 1999). The exclusion interval covered about 34 cM. Kerrison et al. (2001) refined the NYS1 locus to a 5-cM interval between DXS9909 and DXS1211 on Xq26-q27. Genetic analysis excluded mutations in the SLC25A14 gene (300242). Based on examination of an extended pedigree, the estimated penetrance among obligate female carriers was 29% (6 of 21). Guo et al. (2006) reported 2 unrelated Chinese families with X-linked congenital motor nystagmus inherited in a clearly X-linked recessive pattern. Only males in the families were affected, and no obligate female carriers were affected. Linkage analysis identified a candidate region on Xq23-q27 (maximum lod score of 3.53 at DXS1047). Haplotype analysis identified a region between DXS8055 and DXS1205. Guo et al. (2006) noted that the region overlapped with that reported by Kerrison et al. (1999, 2001).

comment: Hereditary pituitary dwarfism is a genetically heterogeneous group of conditions including congenital defects of the pituitary (262700, 262710), autosomal and X-linked recessive panhypopituitary dwarfism (see also 262600), isolated growth hormone deficiency (GHD types I and II) (262400, 173100), defects in the GHRHR gene (139191) and peripheral unresponsiveness to GH, which is seen in the Laron types of dwarfism (262500, 245590). Phelan et al. (1971) reported 4 cases of X-linked recessive panhypopituitary dwarfism in 3 sibships connected through females, Schimke et al. (1971) described panhypopituitarism in 2 half brothers with the same mother, and Zipf et al. (1977) described 2 affected pre-pubertal males. Lagerstrom-Fermer et al. (1997) reinvestigated the family reported by Phelan et al. (1971), which included affected males suffering from variable degrees of hypopituitarism. Some affected males had died during the first day of life and exhibited postmortem findings of hypoadrenalism, presumably due to hypopituitarism. Others had variable combinations of hypothyroidism, delayed pubertal development, and short stature due to GHD. All surviving patients exhibited mild to moderate mental retardation. The possibility of a contiguous gene syndrome appeared to have been excluded by the demonstration by Lagerstrom-Fermer et al. (1997) that affected individuals in the family reported by Phelan et al. (1971) in fact showed linkage with markers DXS737 and DXS1187 in the Xq25-q26 region; X-linked agammaglobulinemia maps to Xq21.3-q22. Lagerstrom-Fermer et al. (1997) found that markers DXS737 and DXS1187 in Xq25-q26 showed evidence for linkage with a peak lod score of 4.12 at zero recombination fraction. An apparent extra copy of the marker DXS102, observed in the region of the disease gene in affected males and heterozygous carrier females, suggested that a segment including this marker was duplicated. The authors speculated that the gene causing this disorder codes for a dosage-sensitive protein central to development of the pituitary. The endocrinologic phenotype of X-linked panhypopituitarism differs from that of isolated growth hormone deficiency that is seen in the form that is associated with X-linked agammaglobulinemia (307200). X-linked agammaglobulinemia with or without (300300) GHD maps to a more proximal location on Xq, namely, Xq21.3-q22. While detection of pituitary stalk interruption syndrome (PSIS) by magnetic resonance imaging is a clinical marker of permanent GHD, the pathogenesis of PSIS is unknown. Pinto et al. (1997) classified 51 patients, 27 of them males, with GHD and PSIS according to whether the GHD was isolated (group 1; 16 cases) or associated with other anterior pituitary abnormalities (group 2; 35 cases). The 2 groups had similar characteristics (frequencies of perinatal abnormalities, ages at occurrence of first signs and at diagnosis, height, GH peak response to stimuli other than GHRH). However, associated malformations were less frequent in group 1 (12%) than in group 2 (54%; P less than 0.01); hypoglycemia occurred in 25% of group 1 and 70% of group 2 (P less than 0.01); and the GH peak response to GHRH was less than 10 micro g/L in 0% of group 1 (4 cases evaluated) and 57% of group 2 (21 cases; P less than 0.05). Thirty-one cases (61%; 25 from group 2) had features suggesting an antenatal origin: familial recurrence (4 cases), microphallus (10 boys), and/or associated malformations (50%; 21 cases). Twenty-seven cases (53%; 22 from group 2) had features suggesting a hypothalamic origin. Pinto et al. (1997) concluded that most patients with GHD associated with multiple anterior pituitary abnormalities and PSIS have features suggesting an antenatal origin, and that the GH1 (139250), GHRHR, and PIT1 (173110) genes do not seem to be implicated in PSIS. Hol et al. (2000) investigated a family in which a duplication of Xq26-q27 was present in 2 brothers, their mother, and the maternal grandmother. The brothers carrying the duplication displayed spina bifida and panhypopituitarism, whereas a third healthy brother inherited the normal X chromosome. Hol et al. (2000) hypothesized that the Xq27 breakpoint is responsible for the spina bifida and that the Xq26 breakpoint is responsible for the panhypopituitarism, as suggested by Lagerstrom-Fermer et al. (1997). Hol et al. (2000) placed the putative gene between DXS1114 and DXS1200, corresponding to the interval defined by the duplication in their family. Solomon et al. (2002) showed that the duplication breakpoints in the families of Lagerstrom-Fermer et al. (1997) and Hol et al. (2000) were different, leading to the conclusion that the causative gene is located within a 9-Mb duplicated lesion. They suggested that increased dosage was responsible for the phenotype rather than breakpoint disruption and that the gene is located in the region Xq26.1-q27.3. Using array comparative genomic hybridization (array CGH) in 3 previously undescribed families with X-linked hypopituitarism, Solomon et al. (2004) identified 3 different Xq26-q27 duplications, which together refined the critical region to a 3.9 Mb interval at Xq27.2-q27.3. Expression analysis of 6 orthologous mouse genes from this region revealed that the transcription factor Sox3 (313430) is expressed at 11.5 and 12.5 days after conception in the infundibulum of the developing pituitary and the presumptive hypothalamus. Since all X-linked hypopituitarism duplications contain SOX3, Solomon et al. (2004) hypothesized that increased dosage of SOX3 causes perturbation of pituitary and hypothalamic development and may be the causative mechanism for X-linked hypopituitarism.

comment: DESCRIPTION The mammalian genome contains a family of genes that are related to SRY (480000), the testis-determining gene. The homology is restricted to the region of SRY that encodes a DNA-binding motif of the HMG-box class (the DNA-binding domain is called HMG for 'high mobility group'). These genes have been named SOX, for SRY-related HMG-box (see SOX1; 602148). CLONING Stevanovic et al. (1993) cloned and characterized SOX3. A reverse transcription coupled with PCR (RT-PCR) was used to amplify SRY-related transcripts expressed during embryogenesis in human fetal spinal cord. Inspection of fragments detected by one of them showed a difference between males and females, suggesting a SOX gene located on the X chromosome. Isolation and sequencing of the gene showed 97.2% similarity to the protein encoded by the mouse Sox3 gene which is also located on the X chromosome. The RACE (rapid amplification of complementary DNA ends) method was used to define the 3-prime end of the transcript and to confirm that the SOX3 gene is expressed. Using the sensitive RT-PCR assay, SOX3 gene transcripts were detected in several fetal tissues. GENE STRUCTURE Collignon et al. (1996) determined that the SOX3 gene consists of a single exon. EVOLUTION Foster and Graves (1994) identified a sequence on the marsupial X chromosome that shares homology with SRY and shows near-identity with the mouse and human SOX3 gene (formerly called a3), the SOX gene most closely related to SRY. Foster and Graves (1994) suggested that the highly conserved X chromosome-linked SOX3 represents the ancestral SOX gene from which the sex-determining SRY gene was derived. MAPPING By use of a panel of somatic cell hybrids containing different terminal deletions of the long arm of the X chromosome, Stevanovic et al. (1993) mapped the SOX3 gene to Xq26-q27. SOX3 appeared to map to a region of about 5 Mb between DXS51 and DXS98. GENE FUNCTION In developing chick spinal cord, Bylund et al. (2003) found that Sox1, Sox2 (184429), and Sox3 were coexpressed in self-renewing progenitor cells and acted to inhibit neuronal differentiation. Active repression of the Sox genes promoted neural progenitor cells to initiate differentiation prematurely. Further studies showed that the ability of the proneural transcription factor neurogenin-2 (NEUROG2; 606624) to promote neuronal differentiation was based on its ability to suppress Sox gene expression, thus showing that neurogenesis is regulated by an interplay between proneural proteins and inhibitory proteins. On the basis of sequence homology, SOX3 is closely related to SOX1 (602148) and SOX2 (184429), and the products of all 3 genes belong to the SOXB1 subfamily and are expressed throughout the developing central nervous system (CNS) (Collignon et al., 1996). All 3 proteins contain an HMG box. MOLECULAR GENETICS SOX3 was deleted in a male patient with hemophilia and mental retardation (Rousseau et al., 1991). This patient had partial primary testicular failure, yet sufficient testicular function was present for male development. Since the mouse homologs of SOX1 (602148), SOX2 (184429), and SOX3 are expressed in high levels in neuronal tissues during development and expression of SOX3 was found in human fetal brain and spinal cord, it is possible that deletion of SOX3 in this male caused mental retardation. One disorder that might represent mutation in the SOX3 gene is Borjeson-Forssman-Lehmann syndrome (301900), which maps to the Xq26-q27 region and is tightly linked to DXS51; maximum lod score = 3.98 at theta = 0.0. The clinical symptoms of mild to moderate intellectual handicap and gonadal defect, including small testes, are strikingly similar to those observed in the patient of Rousseau et al. (1991). Laumonnier et al. (2002) investigated the involvement of SOX3 in families with X-linked mental retardation where the causative gene had been mapped to Xq26-q27. They showed that the SOX3 gene maps to Xq26.3 and was involved in a large family in which affected individuals had mental retardation and growth hormone deficiency (300123). The mutation (313430.0001) resulted in an in-frame duplication of 33 bp encoding for 11 alanines in a polyalanine tract of the SOX3 gene. The expression pattern during neural and pituitary development suggested that dysfunction of the SOX3 gene caused by the polyalanine expansion might disturb transcription pathways and the regulation of genes involved in cellular processes and functions required for cognitive and pituitary development. Solomon et al. (2004) developed an array comparative genomic hybridization (array CGH) for X-linked hypopituitarism (312000), which is associated with duplication of Xq26-q27. In 3 previously undescribed families with X-linked hypopituitarism, they identified 3 different Xq26-q27 duplications, which together refined the critical region to a 3.9 Mb interval at Xq27.2-q27.3. Expression analysis of 6 orthologous mouse genes from this region revealed that the transcription factor Sox3 is expressed at 11.5 and 12.5 days after conception in the infundibulum of the developing pituitary and the presumptive hypothalamus. Since all X-linked hypopituitarism duplications contain SOX3, Solomon et al. (2004) hypothesized that increased dosage of SOX3 causes perturbation of pituitary and hypothalamic development and may be the causative mechanism for X-linked hypopituitarism. Woods et al. (2005) reported a submicroscopic duplication of Xq27.1, the smallest reported to that time (685.6 kb), in 2 sibs with variable hypopituitarism, callosal abnormalities, anterior pituitary hypoplasia, an ectopic posterior pituitary, and absent infundibulum. The duplication (313430.0002) contained SOX3 and sequences corresponding to 2 transcripts of unknown function; only Sox3 is expressed in the infundibulum in mice. Furthermore, Woods et al. (2005) identified a novel 7-alanine expansion within a polyalanine tract in SOX3 (313430.0003) in a family with panhypopituitarism (see 262600) in 3 male sibs with an absent infundibulum, severe anterior pituitary hypoplasia, and ectopic posterior pituitary. This mutation led to reduced transcriptional activity, with impaired nuclear localization of the mutant protein. They also identified a novel polymorphism, 127G-A (ala43 to thr), in a child from Ghana with sporadic combined pituitary hormone deficiency. This polymorphism was identified in heterozygous state in 3 of 19 normal controls from an Afro-Caribbean background. There was no mental retardation or learning difficulties in any of the patients. Woods et al. (2005) concluded that both over- and underdosage of SOX3 are associated with similar phenotypes, consisting of infundibular hypoplasia and hypopituitarism but not necessarily mental retardation. Stankiewicz et al. (2005) reported a family in which 4 women had short stature, speech defects with stuttering and dyslalia, and variable hearing impairment associated with a 7.5-Mb duplication of Xq26.2-q27.1 that encompassed or disrupted the SOX3 gene. A significant proportion of lymphocytes in 2 patients showed activation of the duplicated X chromosome. Stankiewicz et al. (2005) suggested that a dosage effect of SOX3 may be responsible for the speech disorder. ANIMAL MODEL Weiss et al. (2003) found that female Sox3-null mice developed ovaries but had excess follicular atresia, ovulation of defective oocytes, and severely reduced fertility. Pituitary and uterine functions were normal. Hemizygous male null mice developed testes but were hypogonadal. Testis weight was reduced, and there was extensive Sertoli cell vacuolization, loss of germ cells, reduced sperm counts, and disruption of the seminiferous tubules. Null mice of both sexes showed no overt behavioral deficits and normal growth hormone (139250) expression. Sox3-null mice consistently showed overgrowth and misalignment of the front teeth, and some mice had low body weight. Weiss et al. (2003) concluded that Sox3 is not required for gonadal determination in mice, but is important for normal oocyte development and male testis differentiation and gametogenesis. The pituitary develops from the interaction of the infundibulum, a region of the ventral diencephalon, and Rathke pouch, a derivative of oral ectoderm. Postnatally, its secretory functions are controlled by hypothalamic neurons, which also derive from the ventral diencephalon. To investigate the mechanism by which mutations in the single-exon gene SOX3 result in hypopituitarism and mental retardation, Rizzoti et al. (2004) produced deletion of the Sox3 gene in mice and found that the deletion resulted in defects of pituitary function and of specific CNS midline structures. Cells in the ventral diencephalon, where Sox3 is usually highly expressed, had altered properties in mutant embryos, leading to abnormal development of the Rathke pouch, which does not express the gene. Pituitary and hypothalamic defects persisted postnatally, and SOX3 may also function in a subset of hypothalamic neurons. In studies to identify the genetic abnormality underlying X-linked recessive hypoparathyroidism (307700), Bowl et al. (2005) examined Sox3 expression in mouse embryos by in situ hybridization. They demonstrated expression in the developing parathyroid tissue of mouse embryos between 10.5 and 15.5 days postcoitum. Thus, the results indicated a likely role for SOX3 in the embryonic development of the parathyroid glands.

comment: The mitochondrial tRNA for asparagine is encoded by nucleotides 5657-5729. Clayton (1993) pointed out that this leucyl-tRNA, 1 of 2 in the mitochondrial genome, is located immediately adjacent to the 3-prime end of the gene for 16S rRNA (MTRNR2; 561010) and the 5-prime end of the gene for the subunit 1 protein of complex I (MTND1; 516000); and that this particular DNA sequence evolved for at least 2 critical and quite different purposes, i.e., to encode this particular tRNA species, and to sponsor transcription termination at the end of the rRNA gene region. A small, 13-nucleotide portion of the tRNA gene is the minimal element necessary to effect termination, and this process occurs by the binding of a 34-kD protein to this target sequence. It appears that when the target sequence is occupied by this protein, it presents a barrier to the transcription machinery, thereby terminating transcription at this site. The high number of mutations that have been recognized in this gene may be related to the fact that it occupies a critical role in transcription termination.

comment: CLONING Levanon et al. (1994) isolated and characterized cDNAs corresponding to 3 human 'runt domain' containing genes, AML1 (RUNX1; 151385), CBFA3 (RUNX3; 600210), and CBFA1. In addition to homology in the highly conserved runt domain, extensive sequence similarities were also observed in other parts of the proteins. They found that CBFA1 is the human homolog of one component of mouse PEBP2, i.e., PEBP2A (see Ogawa et al. (1993)). In the mouse, PEBP2 (also known as core-binding factor) is a heterodimer consisting of 2 polypeptides: alpha, the DNA-binding subunit, and beta (PEBP2B; 121360), which associates with the alpha subunit and enhances its affinity for DNA. Zhang et al. (1997) cloned the PEBP2A gene. Ducy et al. (1997) cloned the cDNA encoding Cbfa1, which encodes a protein that binds to an osteoblast-specific cis-acting element, termed OSE2, in the promoter of osteocalcin (112260). They showed that Cbfa1 is an osteoblast-specific transcription factor and a regulator of osteoblast differentiation. The CBFA1 gene is also symbolized OSF2. Geoffroy et al. (1998) found 2 OSF2/CBFA1 cDNAs due to an alternative splicing event around exon 8 that affects the transcriptional activity of the protein. Northern blot analysis demonstrated that the expression of human OSF2/CBFA1 is restricted to osteoblastic cells. Terry et al. (2004) identified mouse and human RUNX2 splice variants encoding up to 12 RUNX2 isoforms. They reported 2 alternate promoter regions and start codons, alternative splicing following the exons encoding the central invariant DNA-binding Runt domain, and 2 alternate 3-prime exons encoding different C-terminal domains. One C-terminal domain of 180 amino acids contains a nuclear matrix targeting signal, a repression domain, and a C-terminal conserved motif. The alternate C-terminal domain of 200 amino acids contains a proline-rich sequence and a leucine zipper-like motif. A destabilizing PEST sequence is encoded by both alternate 3-prime terminal exons. Northern blot analysis and RT-PCR detected differential utilization of the 2 alternate promoters and both 3-prime terminal exons in mouse and human tissues and cells and in early mouse embryos. GENE FUNCTION Ziros et al. (2002) examined the relationship between mechanical load and osteoblast differentiation and function. They found that low-level mechanical deformation (stretching) of cultured human osteoblastic cells directly upregulated the expression and DNA binding of CBFA1 to osteoblast-specific cis-acting element-2 (OSE2), which is found in the promoter region of osteoblast-specific genes. There was a stretch-triggered activation of the mitogen-activate protein kinase (MAPK) cascade that included a rapid induction of both JNK1 (601158) and JNK2 (602896) and a more sustained induction of ERK1 (601795) and ERK2 (176948). Ziros et al. (2002) found evidence that CBFA1 and ERK2 physically interact, resulting in phosphorylation of CBFA1 and potentiation of its transcriptional activity. Kim et al. (2003) found enhanced bone formation and accelerated osteoblast differentiation in Stat1 (600555)-deficient mice, resulting in increased bone mass. Runx2 DNA-binding activity was upregulated in Stat1 mutant osteoblasts. Kim et al. (2003) determined that Stat1 interacts with Runx2 in its latent form in the cytoplasm, thereby inhibiting the nuclear localization of Runx2 and its nuclear transcriptional activity. They showed that the Stat1-Runx2 interaction does not require phosphorylation of Stat1 on tyr701, which is necessary for Stat1 transcriptional activity, and it does not require interferon (see IFNG; 147570) signaling. Kim et al. (2003) concluded that bone remodeling by RUNX2 is attenuated by its sequestration in the cytoplasm by latent STAT1. Zheng et al. (2003) identified multiple functional RUNX2-binding sites within the promoter region of the human, mouse, and chicken COL10A1 genes (120110). In transgenic mouse cells, Runx2 contributed to the transactivation of the Col10a1 promoter. Also, decreased Col10a1 expression and altered chondrocyte hypertrophy were observed in Runx2 heterozygous mice, whereas Col10a1 was barely detectable in Runx2 null mice. Stein et al. (2004) reviewed the function of mammalian Runx proteins in osteogenesis. They stated that Runx2 is the principal osteogenic master switch, while Runx1 and Runx3 are expressed in bone cells and appear to support bone cell development and differentiation. Stein et al. (2004) described the role of Runx2 in the structural modification of the osteocalcin gene promoter during osteoblast development. They concluded that RUNX2 acts as a scaffold that controls the integration, organization, and assembly of nucleic acids and regulatory factors for skeletal gene expression. Bialek et al. (2004) determined that the Twist proteins transiently inhibit Runx2 function during skeletal development in mice. Twist1 (601622) and Twist2 (607556) were expressed in Runx2-expressing cells throughout the skeleton early during development, and osteoblast-specific gene expression occurred only after their expression decreased. Double heterozygotes for Twist1 and Runx2 deletion showed none of the skull abnormalities observed in Runx2 +/- mice, a Twist2 null background rescued the clavicle phenotype of Runx2 +/- mice, and Twist1 or Twist2 deficiency led to premature osteoblast differentiation. The antiosteogenic function of the Twist proteins was mediated by a domain Bialek et al. (2004) called the Twist box, which interacted with the Runx2 DNA-binding domain to inhibit its function. Fujita et al. (2004) investigated the role of Runx2 in the differentiation of mouse osteoblasts and mesenchymal stem cells. They presented evidence suggesting that Runx2 and phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase (see PIK3CG; 601232)-Akt (see 164730) signaling are mutually dependent on each other in the regulation of osteoblast and chondrocyte differentiation and migration. Terry et al. (2004) determined that RUNX2 isoforms containing either the 180- or 200-amino acid C-terminal domain were able to bind canonical Runx DNA target sequences. The inverse relationship between proliferation and differentiation in osteoblasts has been well documented. Thomas et al. (2004) found that Runx2, a master regulator of osteoblast differentiation in mammalian cells, was disrupted in 6 of 7 mammalian osteosarcoma cell lines. Immunohistochemical analysis of human osteosarcomas indicated that expression of p27(KIP1) (CDKN1B; 600778) was also lost as tumors lost osteogenic differentiation. Thomas et al. (2004) found that ectopic expression of Runx2 induced growth arrest through p27(KIP1)-induced inhibition of S-phase cyclin complexes, followed by dephosphorylation of the RB1 protein (RB1; 180200) and G1 cell cycle arrest. They concluded that RUNX2 establishes a terminally differentiated state in osteoblasts through RB1- and p27(KIP1)-dependent mechanisms that are disrupted in osteosarcomas. GENE STRUCTURE Terry et al. (2004) determined that the mouse and human RUNX2 genes contain 9 alternatively spliced exons. Exons 1 and 2 contain alternatively utilized promoter regions and an ATG translational start codon. There are 3 alternate exons 5 (exons 5, 5.1, and 5.2) and 2 alternate exons 6 (exons 6 and 6.1). Exon 6.1 is rich in CpG dinucleotides. Stein et al. (2004) described the key regulatory elements contained within the promoter region of exon 1 of the RUNX2 gene. MAPPING By FISH, Levanon et al. (1994) mapped the CBFA1 gene to 6p21. The AML1, CBFA1, and CBFA3 genes all map to chromosomal regions involved in translocations underlying leukemia or myelodysplastic syndrome and, in the case of AML1, a fusion gene has been demonstrated as the basis of leukemia. Zhang et al. (1997) mapped the PEBP2A gene to 6p21.1-p12.3 by FISH. MOLECULAR GENETICS That the CBFA1 gene is the site of mutations responsible for cleidocranial dysplasia (119600) was established by Mundlos et al. (1997), who found that heterozygous deletions of the gene are present in some families, and that in other families, insertion, deletion, or missense mutations lead to translational stop codons in the DNA-binding domain or in the C-terminal transactivating region. In-frame expansion of a polyalanine stretch segregated in an affected family with brachydactyly and minor clinical findings of CCD. They concluded that CBFA1 mutations cause CCD and that heterozygous loss of function is sufficient to produce the disorder. Quack et al. (1999) analyzed the CBFA1 gene in 42 unrelated patients with CCD. In 18 patients, they detected mutations in the coding region, including 8 frameshift, 2 nonsense, and 9 missense mutations, as well as 2 novel polymorphisms. A cluster of missense mutations at arginine-225 (R225) identified this residue as crucial for CBFA1 function. In vitro green fluorescent protein fusion studies showed that R225 mutations interfere with nuclear accumulation of CBFA1 protein. There was no phenotypic difference between patients with deletions or frameshifts and those with other intragenic mutations, suggesting that CCD is generally caused by haploinsufficiency. However, Quack et al. (1999) were able to extend the CCD phenotypic spectrum. A missense mutation (600211.0006) identified in a patient with supernumerary teeth and a radiologically normal skeleton indicated that mutations in the CBFA1 gene can be associated exclusively with a dental phenotype. (In another place in their report, Quack et al. (1999) stated that the mutation was a frameshift and that the patient, in fact, showed a gap in the most lateral part of the clavicle bilaterally, as well as the supernumerary teeth.) In addition, a patient with severe CCD and a frameshift mutation at codon 402 (600211.0007) had osteoporosis leading to recurrent bone fractures and scoliosis, providing the first evidence that CBFA1 may help maintain adult bone in addition to its function in bone development. Rodan and Harada (1997) gave a comprehensive review of the role of the 3 CBFA genes and specifically the role of CBFA1 in normal and abnormal bone development. They pointed out that a difference between the heterozygous CBFA mutations in the human and in mice is the supernumerary teeth in humans, the basis of which remained to be determined. In an extensive review of the genetics of craniofacial development and malformation, Wilkie and Morriss-Kay (2001) provided a useful diagram of the molecular pathways in cranial suture development with a listing of all craniofacial disorders caused by mutations in the corresponding genes. Four proteins were indicated as having strong evidence for existing in the pathway, with successive downstream targets as follows: TWIST (601622)--FGFR2 (176943)--FGFR1--CBFA1. Bergwitz et al. (2001) reported 2 new mutations in RUNX2 causing cleidocranial dysplasia. Otto et al. (2002) tabulated a large number of mutations in the RUNX2 gene that cause CCD; 20 of them were previously unreported. Missense mutations that cluster in the runt domain had been reported in 26 CCD patients. Only 1 missense mutation was found to be located outside the runt domain. The authors stated that R225 mutations arg225 to gln (R225Q; 600211.0008) and arg225 to trp (R225W; 600211.0009) had been identified in 7 unrelated patients. R225 resides within a stretch of basic amino acids at the carboxy terminus of the runt domain. This motif acts as a nuclear localization signal and mutations affecting R225 inhibit the nuclear accumulation of RUNX2 protein. Moreover, at least the R225Q mutation seems to abolish DNA binding (Zhou et al., 1999). Zheng et al. (2005) observed growth plate abnormalities in a patient with a 1-bp insertion (600211.0017) in the RUNX2 gene. Histologic analysis of the rib and long-bone cartilages showed a markedly diminished zone of hypertrophy; analysis of limb cartilage RNA revealed a 5- to 10-fold decrease in the hypertrophic chondrocyte molecular markers VEGF (192240), MMP13 (600108), and COL10A1. Zheng et al. (2005) concluded that humans with CCD have altered endochondral ossification due to altered RUNX2 regulation of hypertrophic chondrocyte-specific genes during chondrocyte maturation. Fernandez et al. (2005) described a case of a 20-year-old woman with features of both holoprosencephaly and cleidocranial dysplasia. She showed premaxillary agenesis, which is part of the holoprosencephaly spectrum, as well as skeletal abnormalities and impacted teeth reminiscent of cleidocranial dysplasia. She was found to carry a de novo 6;7 reciprocal translocation, with breakpoints at 6p21.1 and 7q36. The 7q36 breakpoint maps 15 kb telomeric to the 5-prime end of the Sonic hedgehog gene (SHH; 600725), which appeared to explain the patient's holoprosencephaly phenotype (Belloni et al., 1996). Using fluorescence in situ hybridization, Fernandez et al. (2005) identified a P1 artificial chromosome clone 800 kb upstream of the RUNX2 gene that spans the 6p breakpoint. Fernandez et al. (2005) proposed that the patient's complex phenotype was due to 2 position-effect mutations, 1 at each translocation breakpoint, which altered the expression of the SHH and RUNX2 genes. Fernandez et al. (2005) gave a listing of examples of position-effect mutations in human disease. GENOTYPE/PHENOTYPE CORRELATIONS To correlate CBFA1 mutations in different functional domains with the CCD clinical spectrum, Zhou et al. (1999) studied 26 independent cases of CCD, and a total of 16 new mutations were identified in 17 families. Most mutations were de novo missense mutations that affected conserved residues in the runt domain and completely abolished both DNA binding and transactivation of a reporter gene. These, and mutations that resulted in premature termination in the runt domain, produced a classic CCD phenotype by abolishing transactivation of the mutant protein with consequent haploinsufficiency. Zhou et al. (1999) further identified 3 putative hypomorphic mutations that resulted in a clinical spectrum including classic and mild CCD, as well as an isolated dental phenotype characterized by delayed eruption of permanent teeth (600211.0010). Functional studies showed that 2 of the 3 mutations were hypomorphic in nature and 2 were associated with significant intrafamilial variability in expressivity, including isolated dental anomalies without the skeletal features of CCD. Together these data showed that variable loss of function due to alterations in the runt and C-terminal proline/serine/threonine-rich (PST) activation domains of CBFA1 may give rise to clinical variability, including classic CCD, mild CCD, and isolated primary dental anomalies. Yoshida et al. (2002) performed mutation analysis of RUNX2 on 24 unrelated patients with CCD. In 17 patients, 16 distinct mutations were detected in the coding region of RUNX2: 4 frameshift, 3 nonsense, 6 missense, and 2 splicing mutations, and 1 polymorphism. The missense mutations were all clustered around the runt domain, and their protein products were severely impaired in DNA binding and transactivation. In contrast, the runt domain was intact in 2 RUNX2 mutants, with partial competence for transactivation remaining. One criterion of CCD, short stature, was much milder in the patients with the intact runt domain than in those without. Furthermore, there was a significant correlation between short stature and the number of supernumerary teeth. On the one hand, these genotype-phenotype correlations highlighted a general, quantitative dependency of skeletal/dental development on gene dosage of RUNX2. On the other hand, the classic CCD phenotype, hypoplastic clavicles or open fontanels, was invariably observed in all patients, including those of normal height. Thus, cleidocranial bone formation, as mediated by intramembranous ossification, may require a higher level of RUNX2 than does skeletogenesis (mediated by endochondral ossification), as well as odontogenesis (involving still different complex processes). These results suggested that CCD could result from much smaller losses in RUNX2 function than envisioned by the conventional haploinsufficiency model. In 29 patients with CCD from 19 unrelated families, Baumert et al. (2005) sequenced the RUNX2 gene and identified 12 different RUNX2 mutations. They examined phenotypic data using homogeneity analysis and observed mild to full-blown expression of the CCD phenotype, with intrafamilial clinical variability. Baumert et al. (2005) commented that homogeneity analysis simplified grouping the patients into distinct entities, but noted that the analysis separated individuals with the same mutation, emphasizing the clinical variability within the patient cohort. ANIMAL MODEL Komori et al. (1997) generated mice with a mutated Cbfa1 locus and found that mice homozygous for the mutation died just after birth without breathing. Examination showed complete lack of ossification of the skeleton. Although immature osteoblasts, which expressed alkaline phosphatase weakly but not osteopontin (OPN; 164490) or osteocalcin, and a few immature osteoclasts appeared at the perichondrial region, neither vascular nor mesenchymal cell invasion was observed in cartilage. The data suggested that both intramembranous and endochondral ossification were completely blocked and demonstrated that Cbfa1 plays an essential role in osteogenesis. Otto et al. (1997) likewise generated Cbfa1-deficient mice and found that homozygotes died of respiratory failure shortly after birth. Absence of osteoblasts and bone was demonstrated in homozygotes. Heterozygotes showed specific skeletal abnormalities characteristic of cleidocranial dysplasia (CCD). The same structural defects are observed in the murine mutant (Ccd), a CCD-like phenotype described by Selby and Selby, (1978) as a gamma-ray-induced dominant mutation. Otto et al. (1997) demonstrated that the Cbfa1 gene is deleted in the Ccd mutation. Ducy et al. (1999) studied the postnatal expression of Cbfa1 in mice. The perinatal lethality occurring in Cbfa1-deficient mice had hitherto prevented study of its function after birth. To determine if Cbfa1 plays a role during bone formation, they generated transgenic mice overexpressing Cbfa1 DNA-binding domain in differentiated osteoblasts only postnatally. The Cbfa1 DNA-binding domain has a higher affinity for DNA than Cbfa1 itself, has no transcriptional activity on its own, and can act in a dominant-negative manner in DNA cotransfection assays. Mice expressing this form of the gene product had a normal skeleton at birth but developed an osteopenic phenotype thereafter. Dynamic histomorphometric studies showed that this phenotype was caused by a major decrease in the bone formation rate in the face of a normal number of osteoblasts, thus indicating that once osteoblasts are differentiated, Cbfa1 regulates their function. The study demonstrated that beyond its differentiation function, Cbfa1 is a transcriptional activator of bone formation (the first to be identified to that time) and illustrated that developmentally important genes control physiologic processes postnatally. In light of the absence of reported juvenile or more severe osteoporosis in patients with cleidocranial dysplasia, the observations in mice were unexpected. Ducy et al. (1999) thought that this is probably because of the more severe decrease of expression of the genes encoding bone extracellular matrix proteins, notably type I collagen, in the transgenic mice compared to the heterozygous Cbfa1-deficient mice. During embryonic development, Cbfa1 controls cell differentiation along the osteoblastic pathway; postnatally Cbfa1 has an additional function, directly controlling bone matrix deposition by differentiated osteoblasts. Geoffroy et al. (2002) examined bone marrow stromal cells and cocultures of primary osteoblasts and spleen cells from wildtype and transgenic Cgfa1-overexpressing mice. Primary osteoblasts and bone marrow stromal cells from transgenic mice had stronger osteoclastogenic properties than cells derived from wildtype animals. Expression of Rankl (602642) and collagenase-3 (MMP13; 600108), factors involved in bone formation-resorption coupling, was markedly increased in transgenic cells. Geoffroy et al. (2002) concluded that overexpression of Cbfa1 enhances osteoclast differentiation in vitro and bone resorption in vivo. Zhou et al. (2000) showed that mice carrying a pro250-to-arg mutation in Fgfr1 (136350), which is orthologous to the Pfeiffer syndrome mutation pro252 to arg (136350.0001) in humans, exhibit anterio-posteriorly shortened, laterally widened, and vertically heightened neurocrania. Cranial sutures of early postnatal mutant mice exhibited multiple premature fusions, accelerated osteoblast proliferation, and increased expression of genes related to osteoblast differentiation, suggesting that bone formation at the sutures is locally increased in Pfeiffer syndrome. Markedly increased expression of Cbfa1 accompanied premature fusion, suggesting that Cbfa1 may be a downstream target of Fgf/Fgfr1 signals. This was confirmed in vitro by demonstrating that transfection with wildtype or mutant Fgfr1 induced Cbfa1 expression. The induced expression was also observed using Fgf ligands Fgf2 and Fgf8 (600483). D'Souza et al. (1999) reported a unique phenotype involving dentition in mice lacking a functional Runx2 gene. The markedly hypoplastic tooth organs as well as defects in the maturation of ameloblasts and odontoblasts pointed to an important nonredundant role for RUNX2 in both tooth morphogenesis and cytodifferentiation. To identify genes that are affected by the absence of Runx2, Gaikwad et al. (2001) generated a cDNA library from Runx2 -/- and Runx2 +/+ first molar organs. They found several tooth-specific downstream target genes of Runx2 that included extracellular matrix proteins, kinases, receptors, growth factors, mitochondrial proteins, and transcription molecules. Sequence analysis of 61 differentially expressed genes showed that 96% of the clones matched previously described genes in the GenBank/EBML database. Expression analysis of one of the differentially expressed clones that encodes a zinc finger transcription factor showed that the gene is temporally regulated during tooth development. Gaikwad et al. (2001) noted that the zinc finger transcription factor, which they called Zfp, shares 96% homology with Zfp64. In studies of Runx2 mutants, Aberg et al. (2004) found that developing teeth failed to advance beyond the bud stage and that mandibular molar organs were more severely affected than maxillary molar organs. Molecular analyses showed differential effects of the absence of Runx2 on tooth extracellular matrix gene expression. Yoshida et al. (2004) found that Runx2 knockout mice expressed reduced levels of Ihh (600726), which regulates chondrocyte proliferation and maturation. Adenoviral introduction of Runx2 into Runx2-deficient mice restored Ihh expression. Runx2 directly bound to the promoter region of the Ihh gene and induced expression of a reporter gene driven by the Ihh promoter. Runx2/Runx3 double-knockout mice displayed a complete absence of chondrocyte differentiation and a complete lack of Ihh expression. Single- or double-heterozygous mice showed intermediate degrees of chondrocyte differentiation depending upon the dosages of Runx2 and Runx3 expressed. Limb length was also reduced depending on the dosages of Runx2 and Runx3.

comment: A number sign (#) is used with this entry because tibial muscular dystrophy (TMD) is caused by heterozygous mutation in the gene encoding the giant skeletal muscle protein titin (TTN; 188840). Homozygous mutation in the titin gene causes the more severe limb-girdle muscular dystrophy type 2J (LGMD2J; 608807). CLINICAL FEATURES Markesbery et al. (1974) reported a late adult-onset, autosomal dominant form of distal myopathy with onset in the anterior compartment of the legs rather than in the hands, which is the presenting feature of Welander myopathy (604454). In addition, they reported the occurrence of cardiomyopathy. Edstrom et al. (1980) thought that the family of Markesbery et al. (1974) had a distinct disorder because the affected members showed cardiomyopathy (which was never found in Welander myopathy) and had different histopathologic findings (compare Edstrom, 1975 and Markesbery et al., 1977). Udd (1992) reported a large consanguineous Finnish pedigree with 2 separate muscle disease phenotypes: mild late-onset distal myopathy inherited in an autosomal dominant pattern and severe limb-girdle muscular dystrophy (see LGMD2J) inherited in an autosomal recessive pattern. Segregation analysis showed that the corrected proportion of affected persons with the severe proximal type was 0.246 and the proportion of affected persons with the distal myopathy was 0.58. The findings were compatible with the hypothesis that the severe LGMD phenotype was the homozygous manifestation of a dominant gene that in the heterozygous state caused the milder distal myopathy. Udd et al. (1992), who referred to the distal myopathy as 'tibial muscular dystrophy,' reported follow-up on the large affected Finnish pedigree. Partanen et al. (1994) studied a family with very late-onset (fifth or sixth decade) or asymptomatic hereditary myopathy of the anterior tibial muscle. The muscles of the upper extremity were spared. The anterior tibial muscles had a characteristic myopathic alteration with rimmed vacuoles. Twelve persons, both male and female, were affected, and male-to-male transmission was demonstrated. Partanen et al. (1994) noted the similarity of their cases to those of Markesbery et al. (1974) in that there was late adult onset in the anterior compartment of the legs. However, Partanen et al. (1994) thought that the patients reported by Markesbery et al. (1974) had a far wider involvement and earlier onset of disease. Partanen et al. (1994) distinguished 6 types of distal myopathy: (1) Welander myopathy; (2) a late-onset autosomal dominant form with onset in the anterior compartment of the legs; (3) an early adult-onset recessive or sporadic form with onset in the anterior compartment of the legs with vacuolar myopathy on biopsy (Sunohara et al., 1989); (4) an early adult-onset recessive distal myopathy of the posterior compartment of the legs (Miyoshi et al., 1986; 254130); (5) an autosomal recessive vacuolar myopathy sparing the quadriceps (Sadeh et al., 1993; 600737); and (6) a late-onset autosomal dominant tibial dystrophy as described by Udd et al. (1991, 1992) and Udd (1992). Udd et al. (1993) investigated 66 Finnish patients with late adult-onset tibial muscular dystrophy. Symptoms appeared after the age of 35 years with reduced ankle dorsiflexion, and progression was slow without marked disability. Facial muscles, upper extremities, and proximal muscles were usually spared. Pedigree data suggested autosomal dominant inheritance. The clinical studies suggested homogeneity in the various families affected with this rather frequent disorder in Finns. Van den Bergh et al. (2003) reported a Belgian family with tibial muscular dystrophy. The proband had onset of gait difficulties in his late 40s, and clinical examination showed steppage gait and weakness and atrophy of the anterior compartment muscles of the lower legs without proximal weakness or sensory loss. CT scan of the lower leg muscles showed marked atrophy and low density, suggestive of fatty degeneration. Family investigation revealed that the proband's father, a paternal uncle, and one of his daughters had mild tibialis anterior weakness and atrophy, although all were asymptomatic. In affected members of the family, Van den Bergh et al. (2003) identified a heterozygous mutation in the Mex6 exon of the titin gene (188840.0006). The authors noted that the family showed incomplete disease penetrance. - Pathologic Findings In 12 affected members of a large Finnish pedigree with distal myopathy, Udd et al. (1992) found that muscle biopsy did not show vacuolar degeneration, which was in contrast to most adult-onset distal myopathies. Histopathologic changes correlating with the muscular dystrophy were extensive in tibial anterior muscles in patients with distal myopathy and in all muscles of those family members who had a severe limb-girdle muscular dystrophy phenotype. Among 66 Finnish patients with TMD, Udd et al. (1993) found that muscle biopsies showed nonspecific dystrophic changes in clinically affected muscles and severe adipose replacement in the anterior tibial muscles. Asymptomatic muscles had mild myopathic changes only. Vacuolar degeneration was detected in a minority of patients. Electromyography showed profound myopathic changes in the anterior tibial muscle, but extensor brevis muscles were well preserved. Computed tomography or magnetic resonance imaging of muscles disclosed marked involvement of tibial extensor muscles and focal patches of fatty degeneration in various asymptomatic muscles. In tibial muscular dystrophy, some biopsies showed rimmed vacuoles and others did not. Udd (1997) concluded that the presence or absence of rimmed vacuoles was not indicative of heterogeneity because there was intrafamilial variation and families with or without rimmed vacuoles were shown to be genealogically linked. MAPPING In a Finnish tibial muscular dystrophy family with 11 affected individuals, Haravuori et al. (1997, 1998) found a region of interest on 2q by a genomewide scan with microsatellite markers. Further analyses with additional family members and additional families, 1 of whom was the large Finnish family reported by Udd et al. (1992), yielded a maximum 2-point lod score of 10.14 at theta = 0.05 with marker D2S364. Multipoint likelihood calculations assigned the TMD locus to the proximity of marker D2S324 with a maximum multipoint lod score of 12.4 at theta = 0.0. Haplotype analysis revealed the same core haplotype in all analyzed families, thus providing evidence for an ancestral mutation and further restricting the critical chromosomal region to about 1 cM. The location of the locus was determined to be 2q31 (Udd, 1997; Haravuori et al., 1998). De Seze et al. (1998) described a French family with TMD and confirmed the linkage to 2q31 with a different haplotype for linked markers. HETEROGENEITY - Genetic Heterogeneity Felice et al. (1999) reported a family with autosomal dominant distal myopathy spanning 4 generations in whom linkage to Nonaka distal myopathy (605820) on 9p, MPD1 (160500) on 14q, Miyoshi myopathy on 2p13, and TMD on 2q31 was excluded. Clinical features included onset in the second to third decade of foot drop, difficulty in stair climbing, and progressive leg weakness. Some had later involvement of proximal lower limb muscles and distal upper limb muscles. Laboratory studies showed increased serum creatine kinase and nonspecific myopathic changes without rimmed vacuoles. MOLECULAR GENETICS Because of the map location of TMD on 2q31, the gene encoding the giant skeletal muscle protein titin (188840) was a strong positional as well as functional candidate for the site of causative mutations. Hackman et al. (2002) demonstrated a heterozygous 11-bp deletion/insertion in the last exon (exon 363) of the TTN gene (188840.0004) as the cause of TMD in 81 Finnish patients from 12 unrelated families. One of the families with the 11-bp deletion was the large Finnish family reported by Udd et al. (1992). A different mutation in the TTN gene, a missense mutation that was also located in the last exon (188840.0005), was identified in an affected French family.

synonym: "SONIC HEDGEHOG" RELATED []
comment: CLONING The organization and morphology of the developing embryo are established through a series of inductive interactions (Marigo et al., 1995). One family of vertebrate genes has been related to the Drosophila gene 'hedgehog' (hh) that encodes inductive signals during embryogenesis (Echelard et al., 1993; Roelink et al., 1994). 'Hedgehog' encodes a secreted protein that is involved in establishing cell fates at several points during Drosophila development. Mammalian homologs of hh include Sonic hedgehog (Shh), Indian hedgehog (Ihh; see 600726), and desert hedgehog (Dhh) (Echelard et al., 1993). Like its Drosophila cognate, Shh encodes a signal that is instrumental in patterning the early embryo. It is expressed in the Hensen node, the floorplate of the neural tube, the early gut endoderm, the posterior of the limb buds, and throughout the notochord. It has been implicated as the key inductive signal in patterning of the ventral neural tube (Echelard et al., 1993; Roelink et al., 1994), the anterior-posterior limb axis (Riddle et al., 1993), and the ventral somites (Johnson et al., 1994). The mouse, chicken, and zebrafish Shh homologs are highly conserved (Marigo et al., 1995). Their functional properties appear to be conserved as well. Their probable importance in embryogenesis additionally suggests that alterations in the human hedgehog genes might be involved in congenital anomalies. Marigo et al. (1995) isolated human cDNA clones of the SHH and IHH genes. The SHH clone encodes a predicted protein 92.4% identical to its mouse homolog, while the IHH clone encodes a protein with 94.6% identity to its mouse homolog. IHH was expressed in adult kidney and liver. SHH expression was not detected in adult tissues examined; however, it was expressed in fetal intestine, liver, lung, and kidney. Berman et al. (2003) demonstrated that a wide range of digestive tract tumors, including most of those originating in the esophagus, stomach, biliary tract, and pancreas, but not in the colon, display increased hedgehog pathway activity, which is suppressible by cyclopamine, a hedgehog pathway antagonist. Cyclopamine also suppresses cell growth in vitro and causes durable regression of xenograft tumor in vivo. Unlike tumors in Gorlin syndrome (109400), pathway activity and cell growth in these digestive tract tumors are driven by endogenous expression of hedgehog ligands, as indicated by the presence of Sonic hedgehog and Indian hedgehog transcripts, by the pathway- and growth-inhibitory activity of a hedgehog-neutralizing antibody, and by the dramatic growth-stimulatory activity of exogenously added hedgehog ligand. Berman et al. (2003) concluded that their results identified a group of common lethal malignancies in which hedgehog pathway activity, essential for tumor growth, is activated not by mutation but by ligand expression. BIOCHEMICAL FEATURES Porter et al. (1996) reviewed the molecular processing of hedgehog proteins. They noted that after signal sequence cleavage the hedgehog protein precursor of approximately 45 kD undergoes autocatalytic internal cleavage. This yields an approximately 20-kD N-terminal domain which has signaling activity and a 25-kD C-terminal domain which is active in precursor processing. Hedgehog protein autoprocessing includes peptide bond cleavage and the attachment of a lipophilic adduct to the C-terminal region. Porter et al. (1996) noted that the lipophilic modification is critical for the spatially restricted tissue localization of the hedgehog signal domain. Porter et al. (1996) demonstrated that cholesterol is the lipophilic moiety covalently attached to the N-terminal signaling domain during autoprocessing and that the C-terminal domain acts as an intramolecular cholesterol transferase. They postulated that some of the effects of perturbed cholesterol biosynthesis on animal development, such as those seen in Smith-Lemli-Opitz syndrome (SLO; 270400), may be due to the fact that cholesterol is used to modify embryonic signaling proteins. Zeng et al. (2001) provided evidence for a freely diffusible form of Sonic hedgehog that is cholesterol modified, multimeric, and biologically potent. Zeng et al. (2001) further demonstrated that the availability of this form is regulated by 2 functional antagonists of the SHH pathway, Patched (Ptc; 601309) and hedgehog-interacting protein (HIP). Zeng et al. (2001) demonstrated a gradient of the freely diffusible form across the anterior-posterior axis of the chick limb, demonstrating the physiologic relevance of this form of SHH. GENE FUNCTION Ericson et al. (1996) analyzed the role of SHH signaling in the specification of vertebrate motor neuron identity using cultured explants of chick neural plate, neural tube and notochord tissue, and antibodies which block SHH signaling. They noted that the identity and pattern of cell types generated in the ventral neural tube is controlled by the notochord, an axial mesodermal organizing center. Previous studies revealed that the notochord secretes a locally acting factor that induces differentiation of the floorplate cells at the ventral midline of the neural tube and a diffusible factor that can initiate motor neuron differentiation (Placzek, 1995). Ericson et al. (1996) demonstrated that SHH function is required for the short-range induction of floorplate cells by the notochord. They also showed that SHH function is required independently for the induction of motor neurons by both the notochord and midline neural cells. Ericson et al. (1996) showed that motor neuron generation depends on 2 critical periods of SHH signaling: an early period, during which the neural plate cells are converted to ventralized progenitors, and a late period, during which SHH drives the differentiation of ventralized progenitors into motor neurons. They reported further that the ambient SHH concentration during the late period determines whether ventralized progenitors differentiate into motor neurons or interneurons, thus defining the pattern of neuronal cell types generated in the neural tube. On the basis of their studies in Drosophila, Chen and Struhl (1996) presented evidence that Patched (Ptc; 601309) acts as a receptor for hedgehog (Hh) proteins. They suggested a novel signal transduction mechanism in which Hh proteins bind to Ptc or to a Ptc-Smo (SMOH; 601500) complex and thereby induce Smo activity. Their results showed further that Ptc limits the range of Hh action and that the high levels of Ptc induced by Hh serve to sequester any free Hh and thereby create a barrier to its further movement. Marigo et al. (1996) reported that the Ptc gene product is the receptor for Sonic hedgehog. This was demonstrated by carrying out Shh binding studies on Xenopus laevis oocytes which had been injected with Ptc mRNA. Binding was shown to be dependent on glycosylation of Ptc and on the 2 large extracellular domains of Ptc. Independently and simultaneously, Stone et al (1996) reported that epitope-tagged N-terminal Shh peptide binds specifically to mouse Ptc. They also demonstrated that Ptc and Smo form a complex, and that Shh binds the complex. Stone et al. (1996) noted that genetic mutations leading to a truncated or unstable Ptc protein are associated with familial or sporadic basal cell carcinoma (BCC). They suggested that this finding, combined with the fact that Ptc is a high-affinity binding protein for Shh, suggests that the Hedgehog system may provide mitogenic or differentiative signals to basal cells in the skin throughout life. Stone et al. (1996) raised the possibility that basal cell nevus syndrome (BCNS; 109400) and BCC might result from constitutive activation of Smo, which becomes oncogenic after its release from inhibition by Ptc. Zuniga et al. (1999) reported that the secreted bone morphogenetic protein (BMP) antagonist Gremlin (603054) relays the SHH signal from the polarizing region to the apical ectodermal ridge. Mesenchymal Gremlin expression is lost in limb buds of mouse embryos homozygous for the 'limb deformity' (ld) mutation, which disrupts establishment of the Shh/Fgf4 (164980) feedback loop. Grafting Gremlin-expressing cells into ld mutant limb buds rescued Fgf4 expression and restored the Shh/Fgf4 feedback loop. Analysis of Shh-null mutant embryos revealed that Shh signaling is required for maintenance of Gremlin and Formin (136535), the gene disrupted by the ld mutations. In contrast, Formin, Gremlin, and Fgf4 activation were independent of Shh signaling. Zuniga et al. (1999) concluded that the study uncovered the cascade by which the SHH signal is relayed from the posterior mesenchyme to the apical ectodermal ridge and established that Formin-dependent activation of the BMP antagonist Gremlin is sufficient to induce FGF4 and establish the SHH/FGF4 feedback loop. For a review of the role of this gene in limb development, see Johnson and Tabin (1997). Neumann and Nuesslein-Volhard (2000) showed evidence that in zebrafish, SHH is also expressed in the first retinal neurons and that SHH drives a wave of neurogenesis across the retina, strikingly similar to the wave in Drosophila. The conservation of this patterning mechanism was unexpected, given the highly divergent structures of vertebrate and invertebrate eyes, and supports a common evolutionary origin of the animal visual system. Agarwala et al. (2001) employed in vivo electroporation during midbrain development in chick embryos to create ectopic sources of Sonic hedgehog. Agarwala et al. (2001) provided direct evidence that a Sonic hedgehog source can control pattern at a distance in brain development and demonstrated that the size, shape, and orientation of the cell populations produced depend on the geometry of the morphogen source. Thus, a single regulatory molecule can coordinate tissue size and shape with cell-type identity in brain development. By RT-PCR analysis, Bhardwaj et al. (2001) detected expression of SHH and its receptors PTCH and SMOH in primitive and differentiated (myeloid, B, and T) hematopoietic cells, as well as in stromal cells isolated from bone marrow and in endothelial cells. GLI transcription factors (see 165220), on the other hand, were only expressed in primitive hematopoietic cells, stromal cells, and endothelial cells. Cytokine-induced proliferation of primitive stem cells could be inhibited by antibodies to SHH or by the BMP4 (112262) inhibitor Noggin (NOG; 602991). Cytokine treatment induced an upregulation of BMP4; however, in the presence of SHH, BMP4 upregulation was markedly reduced, as was the upregulation of NOG. On the other hand, treatment with SHH induced the expansion of pluripotent hematopoietic cells in immunodeficient mice. In vitro, NOG could block SHH-induced proliferation of primitive hematopoietic cells. Bhardwaj et al. (2001) concluded that SHH is an important regulator of primitive hematopoietic cells that is dependent on downstream BMP signals. Bale and Yu (2001) reviewed the hedgehog pathway and its disruption as a basis for basal cell carcinomas. Berman et al. (2002) investigated the therapeutic efficacy of the hedgehog pathway antagonist cyclopamine in preclinical models of medulloblastoma (155255), the most common malignant brain tumor in children. Cyclopamine treatment of murine medulloblastoma cells blocked proliferation in vitro and induced changes in gene expression consistent with initiation of neuronal differentiation and loss of neuronal stem cell-like character. The compound also caused regression of murine tumor allografts in vivo and induced rapid death of cells from freshly resected human medulloblastomas, but not from other brain tumors, and thus established a specific role for hedgehog pathway activity in medulloblastoma growth. Wang et al. (2002) demonstrated that sonic hedgehog signaling from retinal ganglion cells is required for the normal laminar organization in the vertebrate retina. Watkins et al. (2003) investigated a role for the SHH pathway in regeneration and carcinogenesis of airway epithelium. They demonstrated extensive activation of the hedgehog pathway within the airway epithelium during repair of acute airway injury. This mode of hedgehog signaling is characterized by the elaboration and reception of the SHH signal within the epithelial compartment, and immediately precedes neuroendocrine differentiation. A similar pattern of hedgehog signaling in airway development during normal differentiation of pulmonary neuroendocrine precursor cells, and in a subset of small cell lung cancer (182280), was also observed. Small cell lung cancer tumors maintain their malignant phenotype in vitro and in vivo through ligand-dependent hedgehog pathway activation. Watkins et al. (2003) proposed that some types of small cell lung cancer might recapitulate a critical hedgehog-regulated event in airway epithelial differentiation. This requirement for hedgehog pathway activation identified a common lethal malignancy that may respond to pharmacologic blockade of the hedgehog signaling pathway. In the embryonic spinal cord, the floor plate chemoattractant netrin-1 (601614) is required to guide commissural neuron axons to the midline. However, genetic evidence has suggested that other chemoattractant(s) are also involved. Charron et al. (2003) showed that mouse Shh could mimic the additional chemoattractant activity of the floor plate in vitro and could act directly as a chemoattractant on isolated axons. Cyclopamine-mediated inhibition of the Shh signaling mediator Smo or conditional inactivation of Smo in commissural neurons indicated that Smo activity was important for the additional chemoattractant activity of the floor plate in vitro and for the normal projection of commissural axons to the floor plate in vivo. These results provided evidence that SHH, acting via SMO, is a midline-derived chemoattractant for commissural axons and showed that a morphogen can also act as an axonal chemoattractant. Bourikas et al. (2005) found that Shh had a repulsive role in postcommissural axon guidance in chicken embryonic development. The effect of Shh was mediated by Hhip (606178) and not by Ptc or Smo. During early development in vertebrates, SHH is produced by the notochord and the floor plate. A ventrodorsal gradient of SHH directs ventrodorsal patterning of the neural tube. However, SHH is also required for the survival of neuroepithelial cells. Thibert et al. (2003) demonstrated that Patched (PTC; 601309) induces apoptotic cell death unless its ligand SHH is present to block the signal. Moreover, the blockade of Ptc-induced cell death partly rescues the chick spinal cord defect provoked by Shh deprivation. Thibert et al. (2003) concluded that the proapoptotic activity of unbound PTC and the positive effect of SHH-bound PTC on cell differentiation probably cooperate to achieve the appropriate spinal cord development. Vertebrate limb outgrowth is driven by a positive feedback loop involving SHH, Gremlin (603054), and FGF4 (164980). By overexpressing individual components of the loop at a time after these genes are normally downregulated in chicken embryos, Scherz et al. (2004) found that Shh no longer maintains Gremlin in the posterior limb. Shh-expressing cells and their descendants cannot express Gremlin. The proliferation of these descendants forms a barrier separating the Shh signal from Gremlin-expressing cells, which breaks down the Shh-Fgf4 loop and thereby affects limb size and provides a mechanism explaining regulative properties of the limb bud. Casali and Struhl (2004) demonstrated that a cell's measure of ambient Hh concentration is not determined solely by the number of active (unliganded) Ptc molecules. Instead, they found that Hh-bound Ptc can titrate the inhibitory action of unbound Ptc. Furthermore, this effect is sufficient to allow normal reading of the Hh gradient in the presence of a form of Ptc that cannot bind the ligand but retains its ability to inhibit Smo. Casali and Struhl (2004) concluded that their results supported a model in which the ratio of bound to unbound Ptc molecules determines the cellular response to Hh. Chen et al. (2004) found that 2 molecules interact with mammalian Smoothened (SMO; 601500) in an activation-dependent manner: G protein-coupled receptor kinase-2 (GRK2; 109635) leads to phosphorylation of Smo, and beta-arrestin-2 (ARRB2; 107941) fused to green fluorescent protein interacts with Smo. These 2 processes promote endocytosis of Smo in clathrin-coated pits. Ptc inhibits association of Arrb2 with Smo, and this inhibition is relieved in cells treated with Shh. A Smo agonist stimulated and a Smo antagonist (cyclopamine) inhibited both phosphorylation of Smo by GRK2 and interaction of Arrb2 with Smo. Chen et al. (2004) suggested that Arrb2 and Grk2 are thus potential mediators of signaling by activated Smo. Karhadkar et al. (2004) found that activity of the hedgehog signaling pathway, which has essential roles in developmental patterning, was required for regeneration of prostate epithelium, and that continuous pathway activation transformed prostate progenitor cells and rendered them tumorigenic. Elevated pathway activity furthermore distinguished metastatic from localized prostate cancer (176807), and pathway manipulation modulated invasiveness and metastasis. Pathway activity was triggered in response to endogenous expression of hedgehog ligands, and was dependent upon the expression of Smoothened (601500), which is not expressed in benign prostate epithelial cells. Karhadkar et al. (2004) concluded that monitoring and manipulating hedgehog pathway activity may offer significant improvements in diagnosis and treatment of prostate cancers with metastatic potential. Roessler and Muenke (2003) reviewed various aspects of Hedgehog synthesis, secretion, distribution, and function in the context of holoprosencephaly (see 236100). The precise specification of left-right asymmetry is an essential process for patterning internal organs in vertebrates. In mouse embryonic development, the symmetry-breaking process in left-right determination is initiated by a leftward extraembryonic fluid flow on the surface of the ventral node. Tanaka et al. (2005) showed that FGF signaling triggers secretion of membrane-sheathed objects 0.3 to 5 microns in diameter, termed 'nodal vesicular parcels' (NVPs), which carry Sonic hedgehog and retinoic acid. These NVPs are transported leftward by the fluid flow and eventually fragment close to the left wall of the ventral node. The silencing effects of an FGF receptor (176943) inhibitor on NVP secretion and on a downstream rise in calcium were sufficiently reversed by exogenous Sonic hedgehog peptide or retinoic acid, suggesting that FGF-triggered surface accumulation of cargo morphogens may be essential for launching NVPs. Tanaka et al. (2005) proposed that NVP flow is a mode of extracellular transport that forms a left-right gradient of morphogens. Using time-lapse imaging, Tanaka et al. (2005) found that these NVPs were transported leftward once every 5 to 15 seconds. Ahn and Joyner (2005) adopted an in vivo genetic fate-mapping strategy using Gli1 (165220) as a sensitive readout of Shh activity, to systematically mark and follow the fate of Shh-responding cells in the adult mouse forebrain. They showed that initially, only a small population of cells (including both quiescent neural stem cells and transit-amplifying cells) responds to Shh in regions undergoing neurogenesis. This population subsequently expands markedly to continuously provide new neurons in the forebrain. Ahn and Joyner (2005) concluded that their study of the behavior of quiescent neural stem cells provides in vivo evidence that they can self-renew for over a year and generate multiple cell types. Furthermore, Ahn and Joyner (2005) showed that the neural stem cell niches in the subventricular zone and dentate gyrus are established sequentially and not until late embryonic stages. Working in Drosophila, Panakova et al. (2005) showed that Wingless (see WNT1, 164820), Hedgehog, and glycophosphatidylinositol-linked proteins copurify with lipoprotein particles, and colocalize with them in the developing wing epithelium. In larvae with reduced glycoprotein levels, Hedgehog accumulated near its site of production, and failed to signal over its normal range. Similarly, the range of Wingless signaling was narrowed. Panakova et al. (2005) proposed a novel function for lipoprotein particles, in which they act as vehicles for the movement of lipid-linked morphogens and glycophosphatidylinositol-linked proteins. MAPPING By PCR analysis of DNA from a panel of rodent/human somatic cell hybrids, Marigo et al. (1995) assigned the SHH gene to 7q and the IHH gene to chromosome 2. SHH was more precisely localized by linkage studies using a CA repeat sequence tagged site identified in a P1 genomic clone of SHH in members of a family with polysyndactyly, or triphalangeal thumb-polysyndactyly syndrome (TPT1; 190605), previously reported by Tsukurov et al. (1994). SHH was found to be closely linked to but distinct from the TPT1 locus at 7q36; maximum lod score = 4.82 at theta = 0.05. It was tightly linked to En2, the engrailed-2 locus (131310). Marigo et al. (1995) mapped the mouse homologs Shh, Ihh, and Dhh by linkage analysis of an interspecific backcross. Shh mapped to a position 0.6 cM distal to En2 and 1.9 cM distal to Il6, or interleukin-6 (147620), on mouse chromosome 5. This location is closely linked to but distinct from the murine limb mutation Hx and is in an area with homology of synteny to human 7q36. MOLECULAR GENETICS Belloni et al. (1996) identified SHH as a candidate gene for autosomal dominant holoprosencephaly-3 (HPE3; 142945) by detailed characterization of HPE3 patient chromosome rearrangements and contigs of the HPE3 region. Further analysis revealed that SHH mapped approximately 250 and 15 kb centromeric of T1 and T2, respectively (T1 and T2 represent the translocation breakpoints in 2 unrelated patients with a mild form of HPE3). Belloni et al. (1996) proposed that the chromosomal rearrangements remove distal cis-acting regulatory elements or exert long-term position effects causing aberrant expression of the gene. Roessler et al. (1996) defined the intron-exon boundaries of SHH by direct sequencing and then designed primers for exon amplification and SSCP analysis in 30 families with HPE3. The authors then identified mutations in SHH which caused HPE3 in these families. Two families that showed chromosome 7q36 linkage demonstrated band shifts on SSCP of exon 1. The mutation in one family was a gly31-to-arg substitution (600725.0001). In the second family the mutation occurred at gln100, resulting in a stop codon (600725.0002) and leading to synthesis of a truncated protein. In exon 2, a nonsense mutation leading to a stop codon (600725.0003) and 2 missense mutations (600725.0004 and 600725.0005) were identified. Roessler et al. (1996) noted that loss of one SHH allele was sufficient to cause HPE in humans, whereas both Shh alleles need to be lost to produce a similar phenotype in mice (Chiang et al., 1996). Roessler et al. (1997) identified a total of 5 different mutations in the processing domain encoded by exon 3 of the SHH gene in familial and sporadic HPE. This was the initial report in humans of SHH mutations in the domain responsible for autocatalytic cleavage and cholesterol modification of the N-terminal signaling domain of the protein. Schell-Apacik et al. (2003) assessed the biologic significance of 2 SHH mutations identified in HPE patients: W117G (600725.0004) and W117R (600725.0005). The studies were initiated in the chick spinal cord and demonstrated in vivo that these mutations perturbed the normal patterning activity of SHH. In addition, these mutations altered the immunoreactivity of the SHH protein, suggesting that the conformation of the protein had been disrupted. Nanni et al. (1999) performed mutation analysis on the complete coding region and intron-exon junctions of the SHH gene in 344 unrelated individuals with holoprosencephaly. They identified 13 unrelated affected individuals with novel SHH mutations, including nonsense and missense mutations, deletions, and an insertion. These mutations occurred throughout the gene. No specific genotype-phenotype association was evident based on the correlation of the type or position of the mutations. In conjunction with their previous studies (Roessler et al., 1996; Roessler et al., 1997), Nanni et al. (1999) identified a total of 23 mutations in 344 unrelated cases of HPE. These mutations accounted for 14 cases of familial HPE and 9 cases of sporadic HPE. Mutations in the SHH gene were detected in 10 of 27 (37%) families showing autosomal dominant transmission of the HPE spectrum, based on structural anomalies. Three patients with SHH mutations also had abnormalities in another gene that is expressed during forebrain development. Nanni et al. (1999) speculated that, given the great intrafamilial clinical variability in kindreds carrying an SHH mutation, other genes acting in the same or different developmental pathways might act as modifiers for expression of the HPE spectrum. They identified a gly290-to-asp mutation of the SHH gene (600725.0011) that was associated with a mutation predicting an expansion of an ala repeat in exon 2 of the ZIC2 gene (603073), the site of mutations causing holoprosencephaly-5. In a second patient, a pro424-to-ala mutation in the SHH gene (600725.0012) was identified both in a child who was deleted for 18pter and TGIF, the site of mutations causing holoprosencephaly-4 (142946), and in her mother, who carried a balanced translocation involving chromosome 18. A third example was a 9-bp deletion in the SHH gene (600725.0013) in a child with HPE who also had a thr151-to-ala mutation in the TGIF gene (602630.0003). Nanni et al. (1999) presented a panel of 12 photographs illustrating the range of severity in holoprosencephaly resulting from mutation in the SHH gene. Nanni et al. (2001) studied 13 patients with solitary median maxillary central incisor (SMMCI; 147250), also known as single central incisor, which is often associated with holoprosencephaly. Although these patients did not have holoprosencephaly, in 1 SMMCI family the authors identified a new missense mutation, ile111 to phe (I111F; 600725.0014), which they suggested may be specific for the SMMCI phenotype since it had not been found in cases of holoprosencephaly or in normal controls. Cleft lip and/or palate can occur in pedigrees with autosomal dominant holoprosencephaly due to mutations in SHH. In addition, animal models have shown that SHH is involved in face development. Orioli et al. (2002) examined the SHH gene in 220 newborn infants with nonsyndromic oral clefts registered in the Latin American Collaborative Study of Congenital Malformations (ECLAMC). They found 15 sequence changes in 13 patients with oral clefts, all of which were found by sequencing to represent silent polymorphisms. Four occurred in introns. No clearly disease-causing mutation was found. The authors concluded that SHH mutations are not a frequent cause of isolated oral clefts. Heussler et al. (2002) reported a large family ascertained following the identification of HPE in the index case by antenatal ultrasound. Six members of the family over 2 generations carried an asp88-to-val mutation in the SHH gene (600725.0015). The family highlighted the intrafamilial variability of expression of an identical mutation. Colobomas are frequently observed in patients with holoprosencephaly. In a proband and his mother with iris and uveoretinal colobomas without optic nerve involvement (120200), Schimmenti et al. (2003) identified a novel 24-bp deletion in the SHH gene (600725.0016). In a family previously reported by Nanni et al. (1999), Verlinsky et al. (2003) performed preimplantation diagnosis for a Sonic hedgehog mutation causing familial holoprosencephaly. The parents had had 2 children with holoprosencephaly. Their second child, a girl with severe holoprosencephaly and cleft lip and palate, died shortly after birth. The girl was found to have a glu256-to-stop mutation in the SHH gene (600725.0017). The same mutation was found in the couple's 5-year-old son, who had less severe facial dysmorphism than his sister, including microcephaly, Rathke pouch cyst, single central incisor, and choanal stenosis (the latter was dilated surgically after birth). He also had clinodactyly of the fifth fingers and incurved fourth toes bilaterally. His growth was slow during the first 2 years but subsequently improved, and his social and cognitive development were apparently normal. The mutation was not found in either parent, although paternity testing showed that the father was the biologic father of both affected children, suggesting a new gonadal mutation in one of the parents. The use of preimplantation genetic diagnosis, followed by confirmation of mutation-prestatus by amniocentesis, resulted in the birth of a healthy girl. Traiffort et al. (2004) developed 3-dimensional models of human N-terminal (SHH-N) and C-terminal (SHH-C) hedgehog proteins and characterized the functional consequences linked to various mutations in the SHH gene, dividing them into 3 classes. In the first group, the production of the active SHH-N fragment was dramatically impaired in transfected HEK293 cells, and supernatants from those cell cultures showed no significant SHH signaling activity in a reporter cell-based assay. The second group showed lower production of SHH-N and signaling activity, and the third displayed an activity comparable to that of the wildtype protein. Traiffort et al. (2004) concluded that most of the holoprosencephaly-associated SHH mutations analyzed have a deleterious effect on the availability of SHH-N and its biologic activity, but that the lack of genotype/phenotype correlations suggested that other factors intervene in the development of the spectrum of holoprosencephalic anomalies. EVOLUTION Human evolution is characterized by a dramatic increase in brain size and complexity. To probe its genetic basis, Dorus et al. (2004) examined the evolution of genes involved in diverse aspects of nervous system biology. These genes, including SHH, displayed significantly higher rates of protein evolution in primates than in rodents. This trend was most pronounced for the subset of genes implicated in nervous system development. Moreover, within primates, the acceleration of protein evolution was most prominent in the lineage leading from ancestral primates to humans. Dorus et al. (2004) concluded that the phenotypic evolution of the human nervous system has a salient molecular correlate, i.e., accelerated evolution of the underlying genes, particularly those linked to nervous system development. ANIMAL MODEL Olson and Srivastava (1996) reviewed the role of Sonic hedgehog in cardiac morphogenesis in the chick and mouse, particularly in the initiation of rightward looping of the heart tube in early embryogenesis. Before looping, Sonic hedgehog is expressed on the left side and Acvr2, the activin A receptor type II (102581), is expressed on the right side. On the right side of the embryo, activin (147290) or an activin-like molecule induces Acvr2a and suppresses expression of Shh, thereby creating left to right asymmetry. On the left side, the nodal-related morphogen (601265) is induced by Shh. Olson and Srivastava (1996) stated that evidence for the role of these morphogens in the control of looping direction is indicated by the finding that looping is randomized when Shh is expressed on the right side or when Acvr2 is expressed on the left side. Chiang et al. (1996) generated mice that were homozygous for a disrupted Sonic hedgehog gene by using homologous recombination in embryonic stem cells. Morphologic studies in these mice revealed defects in the establishment of maintenance of mid-line structures such as the notochord and floorplate. Other defects observed included absence of distal limb structures, cyclopia, absence of ventral cell types within the neural tube, and absence of the spinal column and most of the ribs. Chiang et al. (1996) reported that defects in all tissues extend beyond the normal sites of Shh transcription, and that this observation confirmed the proposed role of Shh protein as an extracellular signal required for the tissue organizing properties of several vertebrate patterning centers. Oro et al. (1997) showed that transgenic mice overexpressing SHH in the skin developed many features of the basal cell nevus syndrome, demonstrating that SHH is sufficient to induce basal cell carcinomas (BCCs) in mice. The data suggested that SHH may have a role in human tumorigenesis. Activating mutations of SHH or another 'hedgehog' gene may be an alternative pathway for BCC formation in humans. The human mutation his133 to tyr (his134 to tyr in mouse) is a candidate. It is distinct from loss-of-function mutations reported for individuals with holoprosencephaly. His133 lies adjacent in the catalytic site to his134 (mouse his135), one of the conserved residues thought to be necessary for catalysis. Oro et al. (1997) suggested that SHH may be a dominant oncogene in multiple human tumors, a mirror of the tumor suppressor activity of the opposing 'patched' (PTCH) gene. The rapid and frequent appearance of Shh-induced tumors in the mice suggested that disruption of the SHH-PTC pathway is sufficient to create BCCs. The mouse BCCs appeared within the first 4 days of skin development, unlike mouse squamous neoplasia where tumors arise 1 to 12 months after oncogene expression. The kinetics of the tumors in these mice were consistent with previous clinical and epidemiologic data, which suggested that BCCs, in contrast to melanomas and squamous carcinomas, lack precursor or intermediate cellular phenotypes. The gene PTCH joins APC (175100) in a class of genes instrumental for controlling early epithelial proliferation. Mutations in APC cause familial adenomatous polyposis, a condition that predisposes individuals to many benign polyps, akin to the hundreds of nodular BCCs that can occur in patients with the basal cell nevus syndrome. Nodular BCCs are reminiscent of polyps in colonic epithelium, as both lack aneuploidy and are locally invasive. Litingtung et al. (1998) found that mice with a targeted deletion of Shh have foregut defects that are apparent as early as embryonic day 9.5, when the tracheal diverticulum begins to outgrow. Homozygous Shh-null mutant mice showed esophageal atresia/stenosis, tracheoesophageal fistula, and tracheal and lung anomalies, features similar to those observed in humans with foregut defects. The lung mesenchyme showed enhanced cell death, decreased cell proliferation, and downregulation of Shh target genes. These results indicated that Shh is required for the growth and differentiation of the esophagus, trachea, and lung, and suggested that mutations in SHH and its signaling components may be involved in foregut defects in humans. Of relevance is the demonstration of Motoyama et al. (1998) that Gli2 (165230) and Gli3 (165240), which are involved in the transduction of Shh signal, are essential to the formation of lung, trachea, and esophagus. Hair follicles form in prenatal skin and mature in the postnatal period, establishing a growth cycle in 3 phases: telogen (resting), anagen (growth), and catagen (regression). Based on the knowledge that Shh expression is necessary for the embryonic development of hair follicles, and that anagen in the postnatal cycling follicle has morphologic similarities to the epithelial invagination process in embryonic skin, Sato et al. (1999) hypothesized that localized, but transient, enhanced expression of the Shh gene in postnatal skin would accelerate initiation of anagen in the hair follicle cycle, with concomitant accelerated hair growth. To assess this concept, an adenovirus vector (AdShh) was used to transfer the murine Shh cDNA to skin of postnatal day 19 C57BL/6 mice. The treated skin showed increased mRNA expression of Shh, the Shh receptor Patched, and Gli1 (165220), a transcription factor in the Shh pathway. In mice receiving the treatment, but not in controls, acceleration into anagen was evident, since hair follicle size and melanogenesis increased and the hair-specific keratin Hb1 (602153) and melanin synthesis-related tyrosinase (see 606933) mRNAs accumulated. Finally, C57BL/6 mice showed marked acceleration of the onset of new hair growth in the region of AdShh administration to skin 2 weeks after treatment, but not in control vector-treated or untreated areas. After 6 months, AdShh-treated skin showed normal hair and normal skin morphology. Together, these observations were considered consistent with the concept that upregulation of Shh activity in postnatal skin functions as a biologic switch that induces resting hair follicles to enter anagen with consequent hair growth. Mill et al. (2003) found that Gli2-null mice showed grossly normal epidermal differentiation, but like Shh-null mice, they exhibited arrested hair follicle development with reduced cell proliferation and Shh-responsive gene expression. A constitutively active form of Gli2, but not wildtype Gli2, activated Shh-responsive gene expression and promoted cell proliferation in Shh-null skin. Using the Cre/loxP system, Sun et al. (2000) found that Shh expression is maintained and limb formation is normal when Fgf4 (164980) is inactivated in mouse limbs, contradicting another model which suggested that Fgf4 expression is not maintained in Shh -/- mouse limbs. Sun et al. (2000) also found that maintenance of Fgf9 (600921) and Fgf17 (603725) expression is dependent on Shh, whereas Fgf8 (600483) expression is not. Sun et al. (2000) developed a model in which no individual Fgf expressed in the apical ectodermal ridge is solely necessary to maintain Shh expression, but instead the combined activity of 2 or more apical ectodermal ridge Fgfs function in a positive feedback loop with Shh to control limb development. To gain insight into the role of SMO in Hedgehog signaling in vertebrates, Zhang et al. (2001) generated a null allele of Smo by gene targeting in mouse embryonic stem (ES) cells. They showed that Smo acts epistatic to Ptc1 to mediate Shh and Ihh signaling in the early mouse embryo. Smo and Shh/Ihh compound mutants had identical phenotypes: embryos failed to turn, arresting at somite stages with a small, linear heart tube, an open gut, and cyclopia. The absence of visible left/right (L/R) asymmetry led the authors to examine the pathways controlling L/R situs. Zhang et al. (2001) presented evidence consistent with a model in which Hedgehog signaling within the node is required for activation of GDF1 (602880) and induction of left-side determinants. Further, they demonstrated an absolute requirement for Hedgehog signaling in sclerotomal development and a role in cardiac morphogenesis. Murdoch et al. (2001) cloned the causative gene for craniorachischisis (a severe neural tube defect) in 'loop-tail' (Lp) mice, which they named Lpp1 (see VANGL2; 600533). Lpp1 is expressed in the ventral part of the developing neural tube, but is excluded from the floorplate where Shh is expressed. Embryos lacking Shh express Lpp1 throughout the ventral neural tube, suggesting negative regulation of Lpp1 by Shh. The authors suggested that the mutual interaction between Lpp1 and Shh may define the lateral boundary of floorplate differentiation. They hypothesized that loss of Lpp1 function may disrupt neurulation by permitting more extensive floorplate induction by Shh, thereby inhibiting midline bending of the neural plate during initiation of neurulation. By in situ hybridization, Treier et al. (2001) detected Shh expression in the ventral diencephalon and oral ectoderm during development of the pituitary gland in mouse embryos. Using loss- and gain-of-function studies in transgenic mice, they investigated the role of Shh in outgrowth and differentiation of the pituitary gland. They targeted overexpression of Hip (HHIP; 606178) in transgenic mice to specifically block Hedgehog signaling in the oral ectoderm and Rathke pouch within the head region and observed a failure of pituitary organogenesis. Using in situ hybridization, Treier et al. (2001) observed an absence of ventral cell-type markers in Rathke pouch. Using a transgenic approach in gain-of-function studies, they targeted overexpression of Shh to Rathke pouch, resulting in an expansion of ventral cell types. Treier et al. (2001) concluded that Shh exerts effects on both proliferation and cell-type determination in pituitary gland development. Inactivation of the Shh gene in mice leads to annular pancreas (167750) in certain genetic backgrounds (Ramalho-Santos et al., 2000). Gut malrotations and imperforate anus (301800), often associated with annular pancreas in humans, are also found in Shh mutant mice. Litingtung et al. (2002) reported genetic analyses in mice showing that Shh and Gli3 are dispensable for formation of limb skeletal elements. The limbs of double-knockout Shh/Gli mice are distally complete and polydactylous, but completely lack wildtype digit identities. Litingtung et al. (2002) showed that the effects of Shh signaling on skeletal patterning and ridge maintenance are necessarily mediated through Gli3. The authors proposed that the function of Shh and Gli3 in limb skeletal patterning is limited to refining autopodial morphology, imposing pentadactyl constraint on the limb's polydactyl potential, and organizing digit identity specification, by regulating the relative balance of Gli3 transcriptional activator and repressor activities. Alcohol is a teratogen that induces a variety of abnormalities including brain and facial defects (Jones and Smith, 1973), referred to as the fetal alcohol syndrome, with the exact nature of the defect depending on the time and magnitude of the dose of ethanol to which the developing fetus is exposed. In addition to abnormal facial structures, ethanol-treated embryos exhibit a highly characteristic pattern of cell death. Dying cells are observed in the premigratory and migratory neural crest cells that normally populate most facial structures. The observation that blocking Shh signaling results in similar craniofacial abnormalities prompted Ahlgren et al. (2002) to examine whether there is a link between this aspect of fetal alcohol syndrome and loss of Shh. They demonstrated that administration of ethanol to chick embryos resulted in a dramatic loss of Shh, as well as a loss of transcripts involved in Shh signaling pathways. In contrast, other signaling molecules examined did not demonstrate such dramatic changes. Furthermore, they demonstrated that both ethanol-induced cranial neural crest cell death and the associated craniofacial growth defect can be rescued by application of Shh. These data suggested that craniofacial abnormalities resulting from fetal alcohol exposure are caused at least partially by loss of Shh and subsequent neural crest cell death. Te Welscher et al. (2002) reported that the polydactyly of Gli3 (165240)-deficient mice arises independently of Shh signaling. Disruption of one or both Gli3 alleles in mouse embryos lacking Shh progressively restored limb distal development and digit formation. Te Welscher et al. (2002) concluded that SHH signaling counteracts GLI3-mediated repression of key regulator genes, cell survival, and distal progression of limb bud development. The limbs of Gli3-deficient embryos were polydactylous, whereas 1 fused forearm bone and no digit arch formed in limbs of Shh-deficient embryos. Disruption of 1 Gli3 allele on an Shh-knockout background resulted in embryos with 2 forearm bones and rudimentary digits. The limbs of double homozygous mouse embryos were grossly morphologically indistinguishable from the limbs of Gli3 homozygous embryos. Te Welscher et al. (2002) showed that, whereas the polydactyly of Gli3-deficient mice is Shh-independent, the polydactyly of Alx4 (605420) mutant mice depends on Shh signaling, Lai et al. (2003) found high expression of the Shh receptor Patched (Ptc; 601309) in both adult rat hippocampus and neural progenitor cells isolated from this region. In vitro, Shh promoted neural progenitor cell proliferation, and in vivo, adeno-associated viral vector delivery of Shh cDNA to the rat hippocampus elicited a 3.3-fold increase in cell proliferation. Injection of cyclopamine, an inhibitor of Shh signaling, reduced hippocampal neural progenitor proliferation in vivo. Lai et al. (2003) concluded that Shh is an important regulator of adult hippocampal neural stem cells. Cooper et al. (2003) identified a defective response to hedgehog (Hh) signaling in the disorders of cholesterol biosynthesis Smith-Lemli-Opitz syndrome (SLOS; 270400) and lathosterolosis (607330). Many of the developmental malformations in these syndromes occur in tissues and structures whose embryonic patterning depends on signaling by the Hh family of secreted proteins. Cooper et al. (2003) reported that response to the Hh signal is compromised in mutant cells from mouse models of SLOS and lathosterolosis and in normal cells pharmacologically depleted of sterols. They showed that decreasing levels of cellular sterols correlated with diminishing responsiveness to the Hh signal. This diminished response occurred at sterol levels sufficient for normal autoprocessing of Hh protein, which requires cholesterol as cofactor and covalent adduct. They also found that sterol depletion affects the activity of Smoothened (Smo; 601500), an essential component of the Hh signal transduction apparatus. Riccomagno et al. (2002) found that the morphogenesis of the inner ear of Shh-null mouse embryos was greatly perturbed by midgestation, whereas otic induction proceeded normally. Ventral otic derivatives including the cochlear duct and cochleovestibular ganglia failed to develop in the absence of Shh. The inner ear defects were due to alterations in the expression of a number of genes involved in cell fate specification including Pax2 (167409), Otx1 (600036), Otx2 (600037), Tbx1 (602054), and Ngn1 (601726). In studies in transgenic mice, Riccomagno et al. (2005) demonstrated that Wnt3a (606359) and Wnt1 (164820) signaling in dorsal regions of the otic vesicle regulates expression of genes (i.e., Dlx5/6, 600029, 600030; Gbx2, 601135) necessary for vestibular morphogenesis. In addition, they found that restriction of the Wnt target genes to the dorsal otocyst is also influenced by Shh. Riccomagno et al. (2005) suggested that a balance between Wnt and Shh signaling activities is key in distinguishing between vestibular and auditory cell types. Thayer et al. (2003) reported that Sonic hedgehog is abnormally expressed in pancreatic adenocarcinoma and its precursor lesions, pancreatic intraepithelial neoplasia. The pancreata of Pdx1- (600733) Shh mice (in which Sonic hedgehog is misexpressed in the pancreatic endoderm) developed abnormal tubular structures, a phenocopy of human pancreatic intraepithelial neoplasia-1 and -2. Moreover, these pancreatic intraepithelial neoplasia-like lesions also contained mutations in Kras (190070) and overexpressed Erbb2 (164870), which are genetic mutations found early in the progression of human pancreatic cancer. Furthermore, hedgehog signaling remained active in cell lines established from primary and metastatic pancreatic adenocarcinomas. Notably, inhibition of hedgehog signaling by cyclopamine induced apoptosis and blocked proliferation in a subset of the pancreatic cancer cell lines both in vitro and in vivo. Thayer et al. (2003) concluded that their data suggested that the hedgehog pathway may have an early and critical role in the genesis of pancreatic cancer, and that maintenance of hedgehog signaling is important for aberrant proliferation and tumorigenesis. Gofflot et al. (2003) developed an in vivo rat model of cholesterol deficiency. Treatment with triparanol, a distal inhibitor of cholesterol biosynthesis, induced patterning defects of the autopod at high frequency, including preaxial syndactyly and postaxial polydactyly, thus reproducing limb anomalies frequently observed in humans. In situ hybridization showed that these malformations originated from a modification of SHH signaling in the limb bud at 13 days postcoitum, leading to a deficiency of the anterior part of the limb. This deficiency resulted in an imbalance of IHH expression in the forming cartilage, ultimately leading to reduced interdigital apoptosis and syndactyly. By using an inversion of and a large deficiency in the mouse HoxD cluster, Zakany et al. (2004) found that a perturbation in the early collinear expression of Hoxd11 (142986), Hoxd12 (142988), and Hoxd13 (142989) in limb buds led to a loss of asymmetry. Ectopic Hox gene expression triggered abnormal Shh transcription, which in turn induced symmetrical expression of Hox genes in digits, thereby generating double posterior limbs. Zakany et al. (2004) concluded that early posterior restriction of Hox gene products sets up an anterior-posterior prepattern, which determines the localized activation of Shh. This signal is subsequently translated into digit morphologic asymmetry by promoting the late expression of Hoxd genes, 2 collinear processes relying on opposite genomic topographies, upstream and downstream Shh signaling. In Fgf10 (602115) -/-, Fgfr2b (see FGFR2, 176943) -/-, and Shh -/- mice, which all exhibit cleft palate, Rice et al. (2004) showed that Shh is a downstream target of Fgf10/Fgfr2b signaling. Using BrdU staining, they demonstrated that mesenchymal Fgf10 regulated the epithelial expression of Shh, which in turn signaled back to the mesenchyme. This was confirmed by the finding that cell proliferation was decreased not only in the palatal epithelium but also in the mesenchyme of Fgfr2b -/- mice. Rice et al. (2004) concluded that coordinated epithelial-mesenchymal interactions are essential during the initial stages of palate development and require an FGF-SHH signaling network. Wilbanks et al. (2004) showed that the functional knockdown of beta-arrestin-2 (107941) in zebrafish embryos recapitulates the many phenotypes of Hedgehog pathway mutants. Expression of wildtype beta-arrestin-2, or constitutive activation of the Hedgehog pathway downstream of Smoothened (SMO; 601500), rescues the phenotypes caused by beta-arrestin-2 deficiency. These results suggested to Wilbanks et al. (2004) that a functional interaction between beta-arrestin-2 and Smo may be critical to regulate Hedgehog signaling in zebrafish development. Yamamoto et al. (2004) used the teleost Astyanax mexicanus, a single species with an eyed surface-dwelling form (surface fish) and many blind cave forms (cavefish), to study the evolution of eye degeneration. Small eye primordia are formed during cavefish embryogenesis, which later arrest in development, degenerate, and sink into the orbits. Eye degeneration is caused by apoptosis of the embryonic lens, and transplanting a surface fish embryonic lens into a cavefish optic cup can restore a complete eye. Yamamoto et al. (2004) showed that sonic hedgehog and tiggy-winkle hedgehog (Twhh) gene expression is expanded along the anterior embryonic midline in several different cavefish populations. The expansion of hedgehog signaling results in hyperactivation of downstream genes, lens apoptosis, and arrested eye growth and development. These features can be mimicked in surface fish by Twhh and/or Shh overexpression, supporting the role of hedgehog signaling in the evolution of cavefish eye regression. Niedermaier et al. (2005) mapped the radiation-induced short digits (Dsh) mouse phenotype to a region of chromosome 5 that contains Shh. Using a positional cloning approach, they demonstrated an 11.7-Mb inversion with a distal breakpoint 13.298 kb upstream of Shh, separating the coding sequence from several putative regulatory elements. The inversion results in temporal and spatial dysregulation of Shh expression with almost complete downregulation during embryonic day 9.5 (E9.5) to E12.5 and upregulation at E13.5 and E14.5, the latter occurring in the phalangeal anlagen of Dsh +/- mice, at a time point and in a region where wildtype Shh is never expressed. Niedermaier et al. (2005) concluded that the formation of phalangeal elements and joints mutually depend on each other and that Dsh is a model for abnormal joint formation. Roper et al. (2006) found that a deficit in cerebellar granule cell neurons in a mouse model of Down syndrome (190685) was associated with reduced mitogenic response of granule cell precursors to Hedgehog protein signaling in early postnatal development. Systemic treatment of newborn trisomic mice with a small molecule agonist of the Hedgehog signaling pathway increased mitosis and restored the granule cell precursor population in vivo.

comment: For background information on the 'hedgehog' gene family, see 600725. CLONING Proper regulation of chondrocyte differentiation is necessary for the morphogenesis of skeletal elements. Vortkamp et al. (1996) isolated a chicken homolog of Indian hedgehog (Ihh). Ihh has biologic properties similar to those of Sonic hedgehog (Shh; 600725), including the ability to regulate the conserved targets Patched (601309) and Gli (165220). Ihh is expressed in the prehypertrophic chondrocytes of cartilage elements, where it regulates the rate of hypertrophic differentiation. Misexpression of Ihh prevents proliferating chondrocytes from initiating the hypertrophic differentiation process. Marigo et al. (1995) demonstrated that IHH is expressed in adult kidney and liver. Berman et al. (2003) demonstrated that a wide range of digestive tract tumors, including most of those originating in the esophagus, stomach, biliary tract, and pancreas, but not in the colon, display increased hedgehog pathway activity, which is suppressible by cyclopamine, a hedgehog pathway antagonist. Cyclopamine also suppresses cell growth in vitro and causes durable regression of xenograft tumors in vivo. Unlike tumors in Gorlin syndrome (109400), pathway activity and cell growth in these digestive tract tumors are driven by endogenous expression of hedgehog ligands, as indicated by the presence of Sonic hedgehog and Indian hedgehog transcripts, by the pathway- and growth-inhibitory activity of a hedgehog-neutralizing antibody, and by the dramatic growth-stimulatory activity of exogenously added hedgehog ligand. Berman et al. (2003) concluded that their results identified a group of common lethal malignancies in which hedgehog pathway activity, essential for tumor growth, is activated not by mutation but by ligand expression. GENE FUNCTION Ihh induces the expression of a second signal, parathyroid hormone-related protein (PTHRP; 168470), in the periarticular perichondrium. Vortkamp et al. (1996) analyzed PTHRP -/- knockout mice and found that the PTHRP protein signals to its receptor (168468) in the prehypertrophic chondrocytes, thereby blocking hypertrophic differentiation. In vitro application of hedgehog or PTHRP protein to normal or PTHRP -/- limb explants demonstrated that PTHRP mediates the effects of Ihh through the formation of a negative feedback loop that modulates the rate of chondrocyte differentiation. Porter et al. (1996) reviewed the molecular processing of hedgehog proteins. They noted that after signal sequence cleavage the hedgehog protein precursor of approximately 45 kD undergoes autocatalytic internal cleavage. This yields an approximately 20-kD N-terminal domain which has signaling activity and a 25-kD C-terminal domain which is active in precursor processing. Porter et al. (1996) demonstrated that cholesterol is the lipophilic moiety covalently attached to the N-terminal signaling domain during autoprocessing and that the C-terminal domain acts as an intramolecular cholesterol transferase. Lanske et al. (1996) investigated the functions of the PTH/PTHRP receptor (168468) by deletion of the murine gene by homologous recombination. Most receptor-negative mutant mice died in midgestation, a phenotype not observed in PTHRP -/- mice, perhaps because of the effects of maternal PTHRP. Mice that survived exhibited accelerated differentiation of chondrocytes in bone, and their bones, grown in explant culture, were resistant to the effects of PTHRP and Sonic hedgehog. Lanske et al. (1996) concluded that the PTH/PTHRP receptor mediates the effects of Indian hedgehog and PTHRP on chondrocyte differentiation. Chen et al. (2001) engineered a transgenic mouse with a ser365-to-cys substitution in Fgfr3 (134934), which is equivalent to a human mutation causing thanatophoric dysplasia type I (ser371 to cys; 134943.0006). The mutant mice exhibited shortened limbs as a result of markedly reduced proliferation and impaired differentiation of growth plate chondrocytes. The receptor-activating mutation also resulted in downregulation of expression of Ihh and PTHRP receptor genes. Interactions between Fgfr3- and PTHRP-receptor-mediated signals during endochondral ossification were examined in cultured embryonic metatarsal bones. Consistent with the in vivo observations, Fgf2 inhibited bone growth in culture and induced downregulation of Ihh and PTHRP receptor gene expression. Furthermore, PTHRP partially reversed the inhibition of long bone growth caused by activation of Fgfr3; however, it impaired the differentiation of chondrocytes in an Fgfr3-independent manner. The authors hypothesized that Fgfr3 and Ihh-PTHRP signals may be transmitted by 2 interacting parallel pathways that mediate both overlapping and distinct functions during endochondral ossification. By comparing PTH/PTHRP receptor -/- wildtype (PPR -/- wildtype) chimeric mice with Ihh -/-; PPR -/- wildtype chimeric and Ihh -/- wildtype chimeric mice, Chung et al. (2001) provided in vivo evidence that Ihh, synthesized by prehypertrophic and hypertrophic chondrocytes, regulates the site of hypertrophic differentiation by signaling to the periarticular growth plate and also determines the site of bone collar formation in the adjacent perichondrium. By providing crucial local signals from prehypertrophic and hypertrophic chondrocytes to both chondrocytes and preosteoblasts, Ihh couples chondrogenesis to osteogenesis in endochondral bone development. Hebrok et al. (2000) found that homozygous inactivation of the IHH gene in mice results in 42% annular pancreas (167750). To gain insight into the role of SMO (601500) in Hedgehog signaling in vertebrates, Zhang et al. (2001) generated a null allele of Smo by gene targeting in mouse embryonic stem (ES) cells. They showed that Smo acts epistatic to Ptc1 (601309) to mediate Shh and Ihh signaling in the early mouse embryo. Smo and Shh/Ihh compound mutants had identical phenotypes: embryos failed to turn, arresting at somite stages with a small, linear heart tube, an open gut, and cyclopia. The absence of visible left/right (L/R) asymmetry led the authors to examine the pathways controlling L/R situs. Zhang et al. (2001) presented evidence consistent with a model in which Hedgehog signaling within the node is required for activation of GDF1 (602880) and induction of left-side determinants. Further, they demonstrated an absolute requirement for Hedgehog signaling in sclerotomal development and a role in cardiac morphogenesis. Wnt signaling (see 164820) defines the colonic epithelial progenitor cell phenotype. Van de Wetering et al. (2002) concluded that the beta-catenin (116806)/TCF4 (602272) complex constitutes the master switch that controls proliferation versus differentiation in healthy and malignant intestinal epithelial cells. Mutations in the APC gene (175100) that activate the Wnt pathway cause familial adenomatous polyposis (FAP) and most sporadic colon cancers (Bienz and Clevers, 2000). Van den Brink et al. (2004) reported that IHH is expressed by mature colonocytes and regulates their differentiation in vitro and in vivo. Hedgehog signaling restricts the expression of Wnt targets to the base of the colonic crypt in vivo, and transfection of IHH into colon cancer cells leads to a downregulation of both components of the nuclear beta-catenin/TCF4 complex and abrogates endogenous Wnt signaling in vitro. Expression of IHH was downregulated in polyps of individuals with FAP and expression of doxycycline-inducible dominant-negative TCF4 restored IHH expression in APC mutant colon cancer cells. The data identified a Wnt-hedgehog axis in colonic epithelial renewal. MAPPING By PCR analysis of DNA from a panel of rodent/human somatic cell hybrids, Marigo et al. (1995) assigned the IHH gene to chromosome 2. Using fluorescence in situ hybridization, Leek et al. (1997) regionalized the assignment to 2q33-q35. MOLECULAR GENETICS Gao et al. (2001) decided to focus on IHH as the gene implicated in brachydactyly type A1 (112500) because of its position in the implicated interval on chromosome 2q35-q36 flanked by markers D2S2248 and D2S360 and because IHH is known to mediate condensation, growth, and differentiation of cartilage. They identified 3 heterozygous missense mutations in the region encoding the amino-terminal signaling domain in all affected members of 3 large, unrelated Chinese families. The 3 mutant amino acids, which are conserved across diverse vertebrates and invertebrates, are thought to be adjacent on the surface of IHH. Hellemans et al. (2003) identified IHH as the gene involved in acrocapitofemoral dysplasia (607778), an autosomal recessive disorder with cone-shaped epiphyses in hands and hips, after genomewide homozygosity mapping in 2 consanguineous families segregating this disorder. In both families, homozygous missense mutations in the N-terminal signaling domain occurred outside the region where brachydactyly type A1 mutations are clustered. ANIMAL MODEL Meyer et al. (2003) created closed midshaft femoral fractures in 6-week-old and 1-year-old rats and periodically measured mRNA levels in the fracture callus for 27 matrix, cytokine, and cytokine receptor genes for 6 weeks. The younger rats healed radiographically by 4 weeks after the fracture, whereas none of the older rats had healed at 6 weeks. All genes studied were upregulated by the fracture in both age groups, with peak mRNA levels at 1 to 2 weeks after the fracture and a return to low or undetectable levels at 4 to 6 weeks. Significantly lower levels of mRNA for IHH and bone morphogenetic protein-2 (BMP2; 112261) were detected in the fracture calluses of the older rats, which may have contributed to slower fracture repair. The return of mRNA gene expression to baseline in the older rats prior to healing may also have contributed to the delayed union. The slower healing response of the older rats did not stimulate a negative feedback increase in the mRNA expression of stimulatory cytokines. Meyer et al. (2003) suggested that if cytokines are administered to enhance bone repair, the age and metabolic status of the patient may influence the optimal timing of their administration. Gofflot et al. (2003) developed an in vivo rat model of cholesterol deficiency. Treatment with triparanol, a distal inhibitor of cholesterol biosynthesis, induced patterning defects of the autopod at high frequency, including preaxial syndactyly and postaxial polydactyly, thus reproducing limb anomalies frequently observed in humans. In situ hybridization showed that these malformations originated from a modification of SHH signaling in the limb bud at 13 days postcoitum, leading to a deficiency of the anterior part of the limb. This deficiency resulted in an imbalance of IHH expression in the forming cartilage, ultimately leading to reduced interdigital apoptosis and syndactyly. By introducing a hypomorphic mutation in the Ext1 gene (608177), Koziel et al. (2004) developed mice producing significantly reduced levels of heparan sulfate. Homozygous mutant mice showed an extended distribution of Ihh signaling during embryonic chondrocyte differentiation, and ectopic heparan sulfate restricted Ihh signaling. The authors concluded that heparan sulfate binds hedgehog in the extracellular space and negatively regulates the range of hedgehog signaling in a dose-dependent manner. In mice with a mosaic ablation of the Pth/Pthrp receptor (168468) in the growth plate, Kobayashi et al. (2005) observed that decreasing Ihh action reduced elongation of chondrocyte columns, whereas decreasing Pthrp (168470) had only a modest effect on column length. Elongation of columns and stimulation of periarticular chondrocyte differentiation were still observed when Pthrp signaling was maintained at a constant level. Kobayashi et al. (2005) concluded that IHH acts on periarticular chondrocytes to stimulate their differentiation, thereby regulating the columnar cell mass independently of PTHRP.

synonym: "GLIAL CELL LINE-DERIVED NEUROTROPHIC FACTOR" RELATED []
comment: CLONING Lin et al. (1993) isolated a specific dopaminergic neurotrophic protein, designated 'glial cell line-derived neurotrophic factor' (GDNF), from a rat B49 glial cell line. The corresponding cDNA was cloned from both human and rat cDNA libraries. The predicted 211-amino acid sequences of the 2 proteins showed 93% homology. The human GDNF precursor is processed to a mature 134-amino acid protein with 2 potential N-linked glycosylation sites; it exists as a homodimer. The mature protein contains 7 conserved cysteine residues spaced similarly to members of the TGF-beta superfamily (see 190180). MAPPING Schindelhauer et al. (1995) mapped the GDNF gene to human chromosome 5p13.1-p12 by fluorescence in situ hybridization (FISH). By study of a cell hybrid panel and by FISH, Bermingham et al. (1995) mapped the GDNF gene to 5p13.3-p13.1. GENE FUNCTION Lin et al. (1993) found that recombinant human GDNF specifically promoted the survival and differentiation of dopaminergic neurons in rat embryonic midbrain cell cultures. GDNF also enhanced high-affinity uptake of dopamine in these cells. No effect of GDNF was seen on GABAergic or serotonergic neurons or astrocytes. Schaar et al. (1993) identified Gdnf transcripts in the substantia nigra and in type 1 astrocytes of rat basal forebrain. Recombinant GDNF promoted the survival and differentiation of dopaminergic neurons in embryonic midbrain cultures and promoted their uptake of dopamine. Oppenheim et al. (1995) showed that recombinant human GDNF could rescue avian motor neurons from programmed cell death. In vivo, GDNF rescued avian and murine spinal motor neurons from death caused by axotomy. Beck et al. (1995) used GDNF to prevent loss of tyrosine hydroxylase (TH; 191290)-expressing neurons in the substantia nigra of adult rat brains after transfection of their axons within the medial forebrain bundle. Tomac et al. (1995) showed that GDNF injected over the substantia nigra or in the striatum of mice could protect cells from the effects of the neurotoxin MPTP in vivo, suggesting a possible use in the treatment of Parkinson disease (168600) since MPTP is known to damage dopamine neurons specifically. In mice, Boucher et al. (2000) demonstrated that Gdnf both prevented and reversed sensory abnormalities that developed in neuropathic pain models without affecting pain-related behavior in normal animals. GDNF reduced ectopic discharges within sensory neurons after nerve injury. Boucher et al. (2000) hypothesized that this may arise as a consequence of reversal by GDNF of the injury-induced plasticity of several sodium channel subunits, and argued that their findings provide a rational basis for the use of GDNF as a therapeutic treatment for neuropathic pain states. The arrest of dorsal root axonal regeneration at the transitional zone between the peripheral and central nervous system has repeatedly been described. Ramer et al. (2000) demonstrated that this regenerative barrier was surmountable with trophic support to damaged sensory axons. In adult rats with injured dorsal roots, treatment with nerve growth factor (NGF; 162030), neurotrophin-3 (NTF3; 162660), or GDNF, but not brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF; 113505), resulted in selective regrowth of damaged axons across the dorsal root entry zone and into the spinal cord. Dorsal horn neurons were found to be synaptically driven by peripheral nerve stimulation in rats treated with NGF, NT3, and GDNF, demonstrating functional reconnection. In behavioral studies, rats treated with NGF and GDNF recovered sensitivity to noxious heat and pressure. Ramer et al. (2000) concluded that neurotrophic factor treatment may serve as a viable treatment in promoting recovery from root avulsion injuries. Durbec et al. (1996) showed that GDNF is a ligand for the tyrosine kinase receptor RET (164761). Treanor et al. (1996) showed that GDNF acts through the GDNF receptor-1 (GFRA1; 601496). In a Xenopus nerve-muscle coculture system, Wang et al. (2001) demonstrated that long-term treatment with GDNF resulted in increased presynaptic transmitter release via enhanced calcium influx through N-type calcium channels. These changes resulted in increased spontaneous and evoked synaptic currents at the neuromuscular junction. GDNF increased the expression of frequenin (603315) in cultured motoneurons, and anti-frequenin blockade attenuated the effects of GDNF, suggesting that frequenin acts downstream of GDNF. The findings showed that frequenin and GDNF mediate long-term synaptic placticity. Japon et al. (2002) found GDNF, GFRA1, and RET mRNA and protein expression in the human anterior pituitary gland. Double immunohistochemistry of anterior pituitary sections showed GDNF immunoreactivity in more than 95% of somatotrophs and to a lesser extent in corticotrophs (20%); it was almost absent in the remaining cell types. Although more than 95% of somatotrophs were stained for RET, no positive immunostaining could be detected in other cell types. Strong positive immunostaining was found for c-RET in all of the human GH (139250)-secreting pituitary adenomas screened as well as in 50% of human ACTH (176830)-producing pituitary adenomas. Positive immunostaining for GDNF was found in all of the GH-secreting adenomas and in 10% of the corticotropinomas. GFRA1 was detected in 90% of the somatotropinomas and 50% of the corticotropinomas as well as in 1 of 8 prolactinomas and 1 of 13 nonfunctioning adenomas. The authors concluded that expression of RET in all of the somatotropinomas and in 50% of the ACTH-producing tumors implies that GDNF and RET could be involved in the pathogenesis of pituitary tumors. Using gene expression profiling, Iwashita et al. (2003) determined that genes associated with Hirschsprung disease (HSCR; 142623) were highly upregulated in rat gut neural crest stem cells relative to whole-fetus RNA. Among the genes with highest expression were GDNF, SOX10 (602229), GFRA1, and EDNRB (131244). The highest expression was seen in RET, which was found to be necessary for neural crest stem cell migration in the gut. GDNF promoted the migration of neural crest stem cells in culture but did not affect their survival or proliferation. The observations made by Iwashita et al. (2003) were confirmed by quantitative RT-PCR, flow cytometry, and functional analysis. - Therapeutic Use in Primates and Humans In rodents, GDNF stimulates an increase in midbrain dopamine levels, protects dopamine neurons from some neurotoxins, and maintains injured dopamine neurons. Gash et al. (1996) found that GDNF injected intracerebrally into rhesus monkeys that had had the symptomatology and pathophysiologic features of MPTP-induced Parkinson disease displayed significant improvements in 3 of the cardinal symptoms of parkinsonism: bradykinesia, rigidity, and postural instability. Kordower et al. (2000) tested lentiviral vector delivery of GDNF, or lenti-GDNF, for its trophic effects upon degenerating nigrostriatal neurons in nonhuman primate models of Parkinson disease. The authors injected lenti-GDNF into the striatum and substantia nigra of nonlesioned aged rhesus monkeys or young adult rhesus monkeys treated 1 week prior with MPTP. Extensive GDNF expression with anterograde and retrograde transport was seen in all animals. In aged monkeys, lenti-GDNF augmented dopaminergic function. In MPTP-treated monkeys, lenti-GDNF reversed functional deficits and completely prevented nigrostriatal degeneration. Additionally, lenti-GDNF injections to intact rhesus monkeys revealed long-term gene expression (8 months). In MPTP-treated monkeys, lenti-GDNF treatment reversed motor deficits in a hand-reach task. Kordower et al. (2000) concluded that GDNF delivery using a lentiviral vector system could prevent nigrostriatal degeneration and induce regeneration in primate models of PD. Gill et al. (2003) delivered GDNF directly into the putamen of 5 Parkinson patients in a phase 1 safety trial. One catheter needed to be repositioned and there were changes in the MRIs that disappeared after lowering the concentration of GDNF. After 1 year, there were no serious clinical side effects, a 39% improvement in the off-medication motor subscore of the Unified Parkinson Disease Rating Scale (UPDRS), and a 61% improvement in the activities of daily living subscore. Medication-induced dyskinesias were reduced by 64% and were not observed off medication during chronic GDNF delivery. Positron emission tomography (PET) scans of [18F]dopamine uptake showed a significant 28% increase in putamen dopamine storage after 18 months, suggesting a direct effect of GDNF on dopamine function. MOLECULAR GENETICS In a patient with Hirschsprung disease (142623) with a known RET mutation and malrotation of the gut, Angrist et al. (1996) identified a mutation in the GDNF gene (600837.0001). The data suggested that RET and GDNF mutations may act in concert to produce an enteric phenotype. Salomon et al. (1996) analyzed GDNF mutations in 173 Hirschsprung disease patients and concluded that mutations in GDNF per se are neither necessary nor sufficient to cause HSCR, but may influence susceptibility to the disease especially in conjunction with other loci such as RET. In 1 of 36 patients with HSCR, Ivanchuk et al. (1996) identified a mutation in the GDNF gene (600837.0003). The patient did not have a mutation in the RET gene and there was no family history of the disorder. Ivanchuk et al. (1996) concluded that GDNF mutations may be causative in some cases of HSCR. Hofstra et al. (1997) discussed the possible role of GDNF in the pathogenesis of Hirschsprung disease. Bahuau et al. (2001) reported a family with neurofibromatosis type I (NF1; 162200), in which 2 children had congenital megacolon due to intestinal neuronal dysplasia type B (601223). The 2 children were found to be doubly heterozygous for a mutation in the NF1 gene inherited from their mother and a mutation in the GDNF gene inherited from their father. Bahuau et al. (2001) suggested that GDNF/NF1 may act as a modifier of neurofibromin function in keeping with interaction between the RET and RAS pathways. Eketjall and Ibanez (2002) characterized the effect of 4 mutations in the rat Gdnf gene on the ability of rat protein to bind and activate its receptors. These mutations corresponded to the substitutions R93W (600837.0001), D150N (600837.0002), T154S (600837.0003), and I211M (600837.0004) in the GDNF gene that were identified in patients with HSCR. Although none of the 4 mutations appeared to affect the ability of Gdnf to activate Ret, D150N and I211M resulted in a significant reduction in the binding affinity of Gdnf for the binding subunit of the receptor complex, Gfra1. Eketjall and Ibanez (2002) hypothesized that although none of the GDNF mutations identified so far in HSCR patients were sufficient to cause HSCR, some may contribute to pathogenesis of the disorder in conjunction with other genetic lesions. Borghini et al. (2002) produced 5 GDNF mutant proteins in COS-7 cells and tested their effect on RET-expressing neuroblastoma cells. The degree of RET receptor activation observed was comparable to that induced by the wildtype GDNF protein. This observation was consistent with the lack of a clear genotype-phenotype correlation of GDNF mutations in Hirschsprung disease patients. ANIMAL MODEL Gdnf -/- mice display congenital intestinal aganglionosis and renal agenesis (Moore et al., 1996). Sanchez et al. (1996) found that Gdnf-null mice displayed complete renal agenesis owing to lack of induction of the ureteric bud, an early step in kidney development. These mice also lacked enteric neurons, which probably explained the observed pyloric stenosis and dilation of the duodenum. However, ablation of the Gdnf gene did not affect differentiation and survival of dopaminergic neurons, at least during embryonic development. Pichel et al. (1996) generated mice that lacked Gdnf expression by targeted mutagenesis. The phenotype indicated that Gdnf was required for effective branching of the ureter during early kidney development and for innervation of the gastrointestinal tract. Similarities between Gdnf- and RET-null phenotypes, in terms of enteric invasion for example, provided genetic evidence for RET/GDNF receptor/ligand interactions. Experimental application of growth factors can alter the density and distribution of axon branches; hence, growth factor release may be one means by which target cells regulate the number of synaptic connections they receive. Nguyen et al. (1998) generated several lines of transgenic mice that overexpressed Gdnf under a muscle-specific (myogenin; 159980) promoter. Overexpression of Gdnf by muscle greatly increased the number of motor axons innervating neuromuscular junctions in neonatal mice. The extent of hyperinnervation correlated with the amount of Gdnf expressed in 4 transgenic lines. Overexpression of Gdnf by glia and overexpression of NTF3 and NTF4 (162662) did not cause hyperinnervation. During the period of greatest hyperinnervation (birth to 3 weeks postnatal), the Myo-Gdnf mice exhibited a tremor. At neonatal ages, the shaking was sufficiently obvious that transgenic animals could be distinguished from their littermates without error. Normal rodent neonates have a tremor that is most obvious during the first few postnatal days and gradually subsides over the next week, which may be analogous to 'jitteriness' in human neonates. Disappearance of tremor corresponded to the loss of multiple innervation in each transgenic line, as it did in wildtype animals. Transgenic Gdnf loss-of-function and overexpression mouse models showed that the dosage of Gdnf produced by Sertoli cells regulated cell fate decisions of undifferentiated spermatogonial cells that include the stem cells for spermatogenesis (Meng et al., 2000). Meng et al. (2000) showed that gene-targeted mice with 1 Gdnf-null allele had depleted stem cell reserves, whereas mice overexpressing Gdnf showed accumulation of undifferentiated spermatogonia. These spermatogonia were unable to respond properly to differentiation signals and underwent apoptosis upon retinoic acid treatment. Nonmetastatic testicular tumors were regularly formed in older Gdnf-overexpressing mice. Meng et al. (2000) concluded that GDNF contributes to paracrine regulation of spermatogonial self-renewal and differentiation. Messer et al. (2000) found that infusion of Gdnf into the midbrain ventral tegmental area of mice blocked certain biochemical adaptations to chronic morphine and cocaine exposure and also decreased animal drug sensitivity. Similar changes were seen in mice already exposed to chronic morphine, suggesting that Gdnf could reverse drug-induced plasticity. Animals infused with an anti-Gdnf antibody and those with targeted deletion of 1 allele of the Gdnf gene showed increased sensitivity to drug-induced biochemical changes and behavior. Chronic drug exposure was correlated with reduced phosphorylation of Ret, indicating a decrease in functional Gdnf signalling. The findings established a functional interaction between Gdnf and drugs of abuse in the mesolimbic dopamine system. Shen et al. (2002) found that heterozygous Gdnf +/- mutant mice recapitulated complex features characteristic of HSCR, including dominant inheritance, incomplete penetrance, and variable severity of symptoms. The lack of 1 functioning Gdnf allele caused a spectrum of defects in gastrointestinal motility and predisposed the mutant mice to HSCR-like phenotypes. As many as 1 in 5 Gdnf +/- mutant mice died shortly after birth. Using a transgenic marking strategy, Shen et al. (2002) identified hypoganglionosis of the gastrointestinal tract as a developmental defect that rendered the mutant mice susceptible to clinical symptoms of HSCR. - Retinal Degeneration The Royal College of Surgeons (RCS) rat is a widely studied, classic model of recessively inherited retinal degeneration in which the retinal pigment epithelium (RPE) fails to phagocytose outer segments that have been shed, and photoreceptor cells subsequently die. Lawrence et al. (2004) found that engineered Schwann cells sustained retinal structure and function in the dystrophic RCS rat. Cells overexpressing Gdnf or brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF; 113505) had a greater effect on photoreceptor survival than the parent line or sham surgery. The authors concluded that their study demonstrated that ex vivo gene therapy and subsequent cell transplantation could be effective in preserving photoreceptors from the cell death that normally accompanies retinal degeneration.

comment: SRY (480000) is the testis-determining gene located on the Y chromosome of mammals. It encodes a protein whose most striking feature is a motif of 78 amino acids conserved with respect to the DNA binding domain of the high mobility group (HMG) proteins. Jay et al. (1995) noted that more than 100 HMG box-containing proteins had been reported at that time and are classified in 2 distinct subgroups according to the sequence-specificity of the binding, the number of DNA binding domains, and phylogenetic considerations (Laudet et al., 1993). An important subgroup of HMG box-containing proteins includes SRY and SRY box-related (SOX) sequences. They contain only 1 DNA-binding domain, and they bind to DNA in a sequence-specific manner. They are all potential transcription factors implicated in the developmental control of gene expression. Degenerate PCR-based methods enabled the cloning and sequencing of a great number of new SRY-related box sequences in both vertebrates and invertebrates. Only a few have been further characterized and, except for SOX4 (184430), which has been shown to be a transcriptional activator in lymphocytes, and for SOX9 (608160), which is the site of mutations causing campomelic dysplasia (114290) (a disorder of bone and sex determination), the functions of the SOX proteins were as yet unknown. Jay et al. (1995) cloned and characterized the human SOX11 gene using the partial clones of both human and mouse SOX11 genes and mapped the gene to 2p25 by fluorescence in situ hybridization. The SOX11 sequence is strongly conserved with the chicken homolog and is related to SOX4. It contains several putative transcriptional activator or repressor domains. The authors observed that the SOX11 expression pattern is consistent with the hypothesis that this gene is important in the developing nervous system.

comment: Lanosterol synthase (EC 5.4.99.7) catalyzes the cyclization of (S)-2,3 oxidosqualene to lanosterol in the reaction that forms the sterol nucleus. Baker et al. (1995) cloned and characterized the human gene encoding lanosterol synthase, which they called OSC, and found that it predicts an 83-kD protein of 732 amino acids. The deduced amino acid sequence is 36 to 40% identical to known yeast and plant homologs and 83% identical to rat lanosterol synthase. A yeast lanosterol synthase-deficient mutant was complemented by the human gene, and a cell-free homogenate of the yeast mutant strain expressed in the human gene was shown to convert 2,3-oxidosqualene to lanosterol. Using exon trapping to identify portions of genes on human chromosome 21, Young et al. (1996) identified coding regions with strong homology to the lanosterol synthase gene of rat and yeast. They mapped the human LSS gene to 21q22.3 between marker D21S25 and 21qter using somatic cell hybrids and chromosome-21 YACs and cosmids. They also cloned a portion of the human cDNA from a brain cDNA library and determined its nucleotide sequence. The predicted human protein shows 83% identity to its rat and 40% identity to its yeast homolog. Young et al. (1996) stated that no obvious candidate human disease exists for lanosterol synthase deficiency and the role (if any) of triplication of this gene in the phenotypic features of Down syndrome is unknown. Roessler et al. (1999) reported the complete structure of the human LSS gene and presented the results of a mutation analysis in patients with holoprosencephaly, one form of which, HPE1 (236100), maps to the same interval as LSS on chromosome 21. LSS was considered an excellent candidate gene for HPE because of the requirement for cholesterol modification of the Sonic hedgehog protein (SHH; 600725), an HPE-associated protein, for correct patterning activity. Despite an extensive pedigree analysis of numerous polymorphisms, as well as complementation studies in yeast on one of the missense mutations, Roessler et al. (1999) could find no evidence that the LSS gene is responsible for HPE1, thus implicating another gene located in the 21q22.3 region in HPE pathogenesis. BIOCHEMICAL FEATURES - Crystal Structure Thoma et al. (2004) presented 2 crystal structures of the human membrane protein lanosterol synthase: the target protein with an inhibitor that showed cholesterol lowering in vivo opens the way for the structure-based design of OSC inhibitors. The complex with the reaction product lanosterol gives a clear picture of the way in which the enzyme achieves product specificity in this highly exothermic cyclization reaction. Thoma et al. (2004) found that human OSC consists of 2 alpha/alpha barrel domains that are connected by loops and 3 smaller beta-structures. The large active site cavity is located in the center of the molecule between domains 1 and 2. The N-terminal OSC region, which is absent from other cyclase sequences, fills the space between the 2 domains and could function in stabilizing the relative orientations. Human OSC is monomeric in the crystal, which is consistent with analytic ultracentrifuge data.

comment: DESCRIPTION Male sex differentiation is mediated by 2 discrete hormones produced by the fetal testis. Testosterone, produced by Leydig cells, virilizes the external genitalia and promotes prostatic growth; anti-Mullerian hormone (AMH), also called Mullerian-inhibiting substance (MIS) or factor (MIF), results in regression of Mullerian ducts which would otherwise differentiate into the uterus and fallopian tubes. CLONING Picard et al. (1986) used mRNA prepared from fetal bovine testicular tissue to construct a cDNA library. They isolated cDNAs encoding a fragment of bovine AMH and showed by Northern blots that the gene was expressed only in fetal testis and adult ovarian follicles. Cate et al. (1986) isolated the human gene for MIF. The gene encodes a 560-amino acid polypeptide. The highly conserved C-terminal domain of the protein shows marked homology with human transforming growth factor-beta (190180) and the beta chain of porcine inhibin (147390). BIOCHEMICAL FEATURES Lee et al. (1997) demonstrated that measurements of serum Mullerian-inhibiting substance can be used to determine testicular status in prepubertal children with nonpalpable gonads, thus differentiating anorchia from undescended testes in boys with bilateral cryptorchidism and serving as a measure of testicular integrity in children with intersexual anomalies. To determine the value of assessing serum AMH levels in the diagnosis of intersex conditions, Rey et al. (1999) assayed levels in 107 patients with ambiguous genitalia of various etiologies. In XY patients, AMH was low when the intersex condition was caused by abnormal testicular determination (including pure and partial gonadal dysgenesis) but was normal or elevated in patients with impaired testosterone secretion, whereas serum testosterone was low in both groups. AMH was also elevated during the first year of life and at puberty in intersex states caused by androgen insensitivity. In 46,XX patients with a normal male phenotype or ambiguous genitalia in whom the diagnosis of female pseudohermaphroditism had been excluded, AMH levels greater than 75 pmol/L were indicative of the presence of testicular tissue and correlated with the mass of functional testicular parenchyma. The authors concluded that serum AMH determination is a powerful tool to assess Sertoli cell function in children with intersex states that can help to distinguish between defects of male sexual differentiation caused by abnormal testicular determination and those resulting from isolated impairment of testosterone secretion or action. Misra et al. (2003) examined the role of MIS determination in the evaluation of 65 phenotypic females with mild virilization. Among the 28 subjects with MIS values above the normal female range, all had abnormal gonadal tissue: ovotestes in 11, testes in 7, dysgenetic gonads in 7, and MIS-secreting ovarian tumors in 3. Among the 37 children with serum MIS in the normal female range, 19 had detectable MIS and 18 had unmeasurable MIS. In the former group with measurable but normal female MIS values, 16 subjects had ovaries, 1 had an ovotestis, and 1 had dysgenetic gonads containing testicular elements. Of 18 children with undetectable MIS values, 16 had ovaries and 2 had ovarian dysgenesis. The authors concluded that elevation of serum MIS above the normal female range was consistently associated with the presence of testicular tissue or MIS-secreting tumors, mandating additional evaluation and surgical exploration. GENE FUNCTION Forest (1997) commented that there is no evidence of any biologic action of Mullerian-inhibiting substance after birth. Its overproduction in patients with sex-cord tumors does not seem to have any harmful effects. Wang et al. (2005) found that motor neurons of adult male and female mice synthesized Mis and expressed its receptors. Mis supported survival of embryonic motor neurons in vitro at physiologic concentrations, suggesting that mature motor neurons use MIS for communication or as an autocrine factor. Wang et al. (2005) postulated that MIS may have a hormone effect in developing males due to the delayed development of the blood-brain barrier, possibly resulting in sex-specific differences in motor neurons. GENE STRUCTURE Cate et al. (1986) determined that the human MIF gene has 5 exons. MAPPING Cohen-Haguenauer et al. (1987) mapped the gene for AMH to 19p13.3-p13.2, using in situ hybridization and Southern blot analysis of a panel of human-mouse and human-hamster somatic cell hybrids. By study of cow-hamster and cow-mouse somatic cell hybrids, Rogers et al. (1991) showed that the AMH and SPARC (182120) genes are syntenic in cattle. SPARC maps to chromosome 5 in the human. MOLECULAR GENETICS Knebelmann et al. (1991) demonstrated a missense mutation in the AMH gene in a patient with AMH-negative persistent Mullerian duct syndrome (see 600957.0001). By linkage mapping, King et al. (1991) demonstrated that the Amh gene is on mouse chromosome 10. This analysis identified a new region of linkage homology between human 19p and mouse 10. Imbeaud et al. (1994) performed molecular analysis of the AMH gene in 21 patients with persistent Mullerian duct syndrome (PMDS; 261550) and their families. In 6 patients with normal serum concentration of AMH, the AMH was normal or contained only polymorphisms and silent mutations, supporting the hypothesis that the condition is due to end-organ resistance. In the 15 remaining patients with low or undetectable levels of serum AMH, 9 novel mutations were discovered. When present in homozygotes or compound heterozygotes, these mutations were associated with the PMDS phenotype, the same mutation never being observed in 2 different families. The first 3 exons of the AMH gene appeared particularly mutation-prone, although they are less GC rich than the 2 last exons and code for the N-terminal part of the AMH protein, which is not in itself essential to bioactivity. Guerrier et al. (1989) demonstrated that not all cases of PMDS are caused by a defect of the AMH gene itself; some patients express a normal amount of bioactive testicular AMH. PMDS, characterized by the presence of Mullerian derivatives in otherwise normally virilized males, is sometimes due to mutations in the AMH gene which abrogate AMH production by the immature Sertoli cells and sometimes due to mutations in AMHR (600956), the AMH receptor gene (Imbeaud et al., 1995). These 2 forms of persistent Mullerian duct syndrome are referred to as types 1 and 2, respectively. Imbeaud et al. (1996) reported results of molecular studies on 38 families with PMDS. They identified the basis of the condition: namely, 16 AMH and 16 AMH receptor mutations in 32 families. Six of the patients were postpubertal, and in these patients determination of the level of anti-Mullerian hormone was no longer informative, since AMH production is normally repressed after puberty. In prepubertal patients, the type of genetic defect leading to PMDS could be predicted from the level of serum AMH, which is very low or undetectable in PMDS type I due to AMH mutations and at the upper limit of normal in receptor mutations. AMH mutations were extremely diverse, and were identified in 16 families, including 9 previously reported families (Imbeaud et al., 1994). Imbeaud et al. (1996) reported that exon 1 and the 3-prime half of exon 5 of the AMH gene are the main sites of deleterious changes including short deletions and missense mutations. ANIMAL MODEL Mishina et al. (1996) produced and examined AMHR2 (600956) knockout mice. They observed that mutant males were internal pseudohermaphrodites, having both male and female reproductive organs. The phenotype of AMH/AMHR2 double-knockout mutant males was indistinguishable from that of either single mutant. Furthermore, the phenotypes of AMH/alpha-inhibin and AMHR2/alpha-inhibin double-knockout mutant males were also identical, suggesting to the authors that AMH is the only ligand of the AMHR2 receptor. Arango et al. (1999) introduced mutations into conserved Sf1 (184757)- and Sox9 (608160)-binding sites within the endogenous mouse Mis promoter. Male mice homozygous for the mutant Sf1-binding site correctly initiated Mis transcription in fetal testes, although at significantly reduced levels. Surprisingly, sufficient Mis was produced to eliminate the Mullerian ducts. In contrast, males homozygous for the mutant Sox9-binding site did not initiate Mis transcription, resulting in pseudohermaphrodites. These studies suggested an essential role for SOX9 in the initiation of MIS transcription, whereas SF1 appeared to act as a quantitative regulator of MIS transcript levels, perhaps for influencing non-Mullerian duct tissues. Comparative studies of MIS expression in vertebrates indicated that the MIS promoter receives transcriptional inputs that vary between species but result in the same functional readout. NOMENCLATURE Because MIF is also used as the symbol for macrophage migration inhibitory factor (153620), AMH, for anti-Mullerian hormone, will be considered the preferred symbol for the locus on chromosome 19.

comment: Sandler et al. (1995) reported a boy and a girl from unrelated families with bilateral anophthalmia and proximal esophageal atresia. In addition to vestigial optic nerves and chiasma, MRI studies showed other central nervous system abnormalities: one had ectopic tissue in the hypothalamic region and the other had generalized ventriculomegaly associated with atrophy. Two other cases, both in males, had previously been reported with anophthalmia and esophageal atresia as the only malformations. Sandler et al.

(1999) reported 2 male patients with unilateral microphthalmia and esophageal atresia as well as psychomotor delay and hearing impairment. The authors concluded that these cases provide further support for recognizing this association as a distinct syndrome. Menetrey et al. (2002) reported a newborn female with bilateral anophthalmia and esophageal atresia. They stated that this was the seventh reported case of this syndrome and noted that all cases have been sporadic. Messina et al. (2003) reported a male infant with left microphthalmia, esophageal atresia, and marked hypoplasia of the entire left half of the body. A chorioretinal coloboma was noted in the right eye; on CT scan, there was diffuse hypodensity of the white matter of both hemispheres. Bonneau et al. (2004) reported the eleventh case of anophthalmia/microphthalmia and esophageal atresia (AMEA). In her neonatal period, the proband had been operated on for type III esophageal atresia. At the age of 6 years, she received an ocular prosthesis for colobomatous microphthalmia of the right eye. The left eye was normal. No deletion of the SOX2 locus (184429), which had been implicated in anophthalmia/microphthalmia, was found; a search for SOX2 mutations was not performed.

comment: DESCRIPTION The vertebrate SIX genes are homologs of the Drosophila 'sine oculis' (so) gene, which is expressed primarily in the developing visual system of the fly. Members of the SIX gene family encode proteins that are characterized by a divergent DNA-binding homeodomain and an upstream SIX domain, which may be involved both in determining DNA-binding specificity and in mediating protein-protein interactions. Genes in the SIX family have been shown to play roles in vertebrate and insect development or have been implicated in maintenance of the differentiated state of tissues. CLONING Boucher et al. (1996) cloned and sequenced a human SIX1 cDNA and showed by Northern blotting that it is expressed in adult skeletal muscle. The cDNA sequence and predicted protein sequence of the human and mouse genes are highly homologous, with 98% similarity over the entire predicted amino acid sequence. During mouse limb development at embryonic day 11.5, Six1 and Six2 are expressed distally over the posterior and anterior limb regions, respectively. However, by E14.5, expression of Six1 and Six2 is detected flanking the phalanges in domains corresponding to the anterior-posterior and dorsoventral axes, respectively. Six1 is also weakly expressed in skeletal muscles of the head and body during late development. Ford et al. (1998) cloned the human SIX1 homeobox gene from late S phase mammary carcinoma cells and demonstrated that overexpression of SIX1 leads to an abrogation of the DNA damage-induced G2 cell cycle checkpoint. In addition, they found that overexpression of SIX1 occurs in a large percentage of mammary carcinomas and correlates strongly with metastatic breast disease. It appeared that studies of several cancer cell lines suggested that SIX1 may be overexpressed in multiple types of tumors. Thus, the studies linked SIX1 to the cell cycle as well as to tumor progression and provided further evidence that 'master regulators' involved in development may contribute to tumorigenicity. GENE FUNCTION Ridgeway and Skerjanc (2001) induced myogenesis in a mouse pluripotent stem cell line. Myogenesis was associated with increased expression of Pax3 (606597), followed by expression of the transcription factor Six1, its cofactor Eya2 (601654), and the transcription factor Mox1 (600147), prior to the induction of MyoD (159970) and myogenin (Myog; 159980) expression. Yu et al. (2004) established highly and poorly metastatic rhabdomyosarcoma cell lines derived from a transgenic mouse model overexpressing Hgf/Sf (142409) and deficient for Ink4a/Arf (600160), in which skeletal muscle tumors reminiscent of those in embryonic rhabdomyosarcoma (268210) arise with very high penetrance and short latency (Sharp et al., 2002). Yu et al. (2004) then used cDNA microarray analysis of these cell lines to identify a set of genes whose expression was significantly different between highly and poorly metastatic cells. Subsequent in vivo functional studies revealed that ezrin, ecoded by Vil2 (123900), and Six1 have essential roles in determining the metastatic fate of rhabdomyosarcoma cells. VIL2 and SIX1 expression was enhanced in human rhabdomyosarcoma tissue, significantly correlating with clinical stage. EVOLUTION Gallardo et al. (1999) performed phylogenetic analysis of SIX gene family members and presented a model for the origin and evolution of SIX gene clusters. MAPPING Using a rodent/human somatic cell hybrid panel, Boucher et al. (1996) mapped the human SIX1 gene to chromosome 14. Oliver et al. (1995) mapped the mouse Six1 gene to the central region of chromosome 12. MOLECULAR GENETICS Branchiootorenal dysplasia (113650) is an autosomal dominant disorder characterized by hearing loss, branchial cleft fistulas or cysts, and renal dysplasia. The disorder results from mutation in the EYA1 gene (601653). Buller et al. (2001) analyzed the functional importance of Eya domain missense mutations with respect to protein complex formation and cellular localization. Previously described point mutations did not alter protein localization; however, 3 mutations (glu330 to lys, 601653.0009; ser454 to pro, 601653.0012; and leu472 to arg, 601653.0013) disrupted interactions between Eya and Six1 in both yeast and mammalian cells. Binding to Six2 (604994) was not impeded. ANIMAL MODEL Li et al. (2003) reported that Six1 is required for the development of murine kidney, muscle, and inner ear and that it exhibits synergistic genetic interactions with Eya factors. Li et al. (2003) demonstrated that the Eya family has a protein phosphatase function, and that its enzymatic activity is required for regulating genes encoding growth control and signaling molecules, modulating precursor cell proliferation. The phosphatase function of Eya switches the function of Six1-Dach (603803) from repression to activation, causing transcriptional activation through recruitment of coactivators. The gene-specific recruitment of a coactivator with intrinsic phosphatase activity provides a molecular mechanism for activation of specific gene targets, including those regulating precursor cell proliferation and survival in mammalian organogenesis. Eya1 +/- Six1 +/- double heterozygous mice had a defect in kidney development, which was not observed in single heterozygotes for either gene deletion, suggesting that Six1 and Eya1 act in the same genetic pathway. Notably, there was a complete absence of all hypaxial muscle in Six1 -/- Eya1 -/- double knockout mice and severe reduction of epaxial muscle, a phenotype resembling that seen in mice homozygous for deletion of Myog and in double knockouts for MyoD/Myf5 (159990) and Pax3/Myf5. Interestingly, although mutation of Six1 or Eya1 has minimal or no effect on pituitary development, mice with both genes deleted have a pituitary that is approximately 5- to 10-fold smaller by volume than the wildtype gland.

comment: DESCRIPTION SRY-related HMG-box (SOX) genes encode a family of DNA-binding proteins containing a 79-amino acid HMG (high mobility group) domain that shares at least 50% sequence identity with the DNA-binding HMG box of the SRY protein (480000). SOX proteins are divided into 6 subgroups based on sequence similarity within and outside of the HMG domain. For additional background information on SOX genes, see SOX1 (602148). CLONING By use of a SOX9 (608160) cDNA as a hybridization probe, Meyer et al. (1996) discovered a new member of the SOX gene family, which they called SOX20, but which was later designated SOX15 by the HUGO Nomenclature Committee. They found that SOX15 has a high similarity to the deduced amino acid sequence of human SOX12 (601947) and murine Sox16 HMG domains. By PCR of human genomic DNA using highly degenerate oligonucleotides designed to amplify HMG box-related sequences, Cremazy et al. (1998) identified several novel SOX sequences, including SOX15, which they mistakenly reported as partial sequences of 2 separate genes designated SOX26 and SOX27. MAPPING By fluorescence in situ hybridization (FISH), Meyer et al. (1996) mapped the SOX15 gene to 17p13. Critcher et al. (1998) used FISH to refine the localization to 17p12.3. Vujic et al. (1998) assigned the SOX15 gene to 17p13.1 by the study of a radiation hybrid panel. ANIMAL MODEL Lee et al. (2004) reported that Northern blot and RT-PCR analyses in mice showed that Sox15 is highly expressed in primary satellite cell-derived myoblasts but not in differentiated myogenic cells. Sox15-null mice were viable and fertile and showed normal skeletal muscle development. In particular, satellite cells were normal, excluding a role for Sox15 in the development of satellite cells; however, skeletal muscle regeneration was impaired in the Sox15-null mice after crush injury, and cultured Sox15-null myoblasts displayed a marked delay in differentiation potential compared to wildtype cells. Lee et al. (2004) concluded that SOX15 plays a role in the regulation of skeletal muscle myogenesis.

comment: DESCRIPTION The Drosophila 'patched' (ptc) gene encodes a transmembrane protein that represses transcription in specific cells of genes encoding members of the TGF-beta (see 190180) and Wnt (164820) families of signaling proteins. Vertebrate homologs of ptc have been identified in mice, chickens, and zebrafish. CLONING Johnson et al. (1996) reported the isolation and mapping of the human homolog of the Drosophila ptc gene. They also reported that this gene is a candidate gene for the basal cell nevus syndrome (BCNS; 109400), also called Gorlin syndrome. Johnson et al. (1996) cloned the human PTC gene by screening a human lung cDNA library with mouse ptc cDNA clones. They assembled 5.1 kb of contiguous sequence containing a 4.5-kb open reading frame that encodes a 1,447-amino acid protein. The predicted amino acid sequence has 96% identity to mouse and a 40% identity to Drosophila ptc proteins. The human PTC protein is predicted to contain 12 hydrophobic membrane-spanning domains and 2 large hydrophilic extracellular loops. Hahn et al. (1996) likewise isolated a human sequence with strong homology to the Drosophila segment polarity gene 'patched' from a YAC and cosmid contig of the nevoid basal cell carcinoma (NBCCS) region on chromosome 9q22.3. Using RT-PCR, Nagao et al. (2005) identified 7 human PTCH transcripts that differ through their use of 5 possible first exons and alternative splicing involving 2 of the possible first exons. These mRNAs encode 4 PTCH proteins with different N termini, including one, designated PTCH-S, that is N-terminally truncated and lacks the first transmembrane domain. RT-PCR detected expression of PTCH in all tissues examined, with lowest levels in heart and liver. Expression of individual PTCH transcripts was tissue specific. Nagao et al. (2005) also identified multiple Ptch splice variants in mouse. During mouse embryonic development, expression of Ptch was highest at embryonic day 10.5, and it declined thereafter. GENE FUNCTION To assess the role of Ptc in cell physiology and development, Marigo et al. (1996) expressed the chick patched gene in Xenopus laevis oocytes (oocytes do not express endogenous Ptc). Protein of the size expected for Ptc was detected 48 hours after injection. They then performed binding assays on injected, uninjected, and control-injected oocytes using the N-terminal fragment (N-Shh) of human Sonic hedgehog protein (SHH; 600725). The binding assay showed that labeled N-Shh protein could bind to Ptc-injected oocytes, but not to the control oocytes. Injected oocytes bound human N-Shh produced in E. coli and mouse N-Shh produced in the baculovirus system. Marigo et al. (1996) demonstrated direct interaction between Ptc and Shh using coimmunoprecipitation studies. They also showed that the 2 extracellular loops of the Ptc protein are necessary for binding and that binding also requires that the Ptc protein be glycosylated. Marigo et al. (1996) proposed that Ptc does not carry out signaling to the cell directly but that an additional molecule is involved, namely the 7-transmembrane protein 'Smoothened ' (SMO; 601500). Independently and simultaneously, Stone et al. (1996) concluded that the Ptc gene encodes a candidate receptor for Shh by showing that epitope-tagged N-Shh binds specifically to human embryonic kidney 293 cells expressing mouse Ptc. Ptc also could be immunoprecipitated by N-Shh-IgG. The authors calculated a K(d) of 460 picoM for binding of N-Shh and mouse Ptc. By expression of genes in 293 cells with subsequent lysis and immunoprecipitation, Stone et al. (1996) showed that Ptc, Smo, and Shh form a physical complex in vivo and that a Smo-Shh complex does not form in the absence of Ptc. They proposed that the Hedgehog system may provide mitogenic or differentiative signals to basal cells in the skin throughout life. They also raised the possibility that BCNS and BCC might result from constitutive activation of Smo which becomes oncogenic after its release from inhibition by Ptc. On the basis of their studies in Drosophila, Chen and Struhl (1996) presented evidence that Ptc acts as a receptor for hedgehog (Hh) proteins. They suggested a novel signal transduction mechanism in which Hh proteins bind to Ptc or to a Ptc-Smo complex and thereby induces Smo activity. Their results showed further that Ptc limits the range of Hh action and that the high levels of Ptc induced by Hh serve to sequester any free Hh and thereby create a barrier to its further movement. Basal cell carcinoma, medulloblastoma, rhabdomyosarcoma, and other human tumors are associated with mutations that activate the protooncogene 'Smoothened' or that inactivate the tumor suppressor 'Patched.' Smoothened and Patched mediate the cellular response to the Hedgehog secreted protein signal, and oncogenic mutations affecting these proteins cause excess activity of the Hedgehog response pathway. Taipale et al. (2000) showed that the plant-derived teratogen cyclopamine, which inhibits the Hedgehog response, is a potential mechanism-based therapeutic agent for treatment of these tumors. Taipale et al. (2000) showed that cyclopamine or synthetic derivatives with improved potency block activation of the Hedgehog response pathway and abnormal cell growth associated with both types of oncogenic mutation. Taipale et al. (2000) concluded that cyclopamine may act by influencing the balance between active and inactive forms of Smoothened. Bale and Yu (2001) reviewed the hedgehog pathway and its disruption as a basis for basal cell carcinomas. Taipale et al. (2002) reported that Ptc and Smo are not significantly associated with hedgehog-responsive cells and that free Ptc (unbound by hedgehog) acts substoichiometrically to suppress Smo activity and thus is critical in specifying the level of pathway activity. Patched is a 12-transmembrane protein with homology to bacterial proton-driven transmembrane molecular transporters. Taipale et al. (2002) demonstrated that the function of Ptc is impaired by alterations of residues that are conserved in and required for function of these bacterial transporters. Taipale et al. (2002) suggested that the Ptc tumor suppressor functions normally as a transmembrane molecular transporter, which acts indirectly to inhibit Smo activity, possibly through changes in distribution or concentration of a small molecule. During early development in vertebrates, SHH is produced by the notochord and the floor plate. A ventrodorsal gradient of SHH directs ventrodorsal patterning of the neural tube. However, SHH is also required for the survival of neuroepithelial cells. Thibert et al. (2003) demonstrated that PTC induces apoptotic cell death unless its ligand SHH is present to block the signal. Moreover, the blockade of Ptc-induced cell death partly rescues the chick spinal cord defect provoked by Shh deprivation. Thibert et al. (2003) concluded that the proapoptotic activity of unbound PTC and the positive effect of SHH-bound PTC on cell differentiation probably cooperate to achieve the appropriate spinal cord development. Casali and Struhl (2004) demonstrated that a cell's measure of ambient Hh concentration is not determined solely by the number of active (unliganded) Ptc molecules. Instead, they found that Hh-bound Ptc can titrate the inhibitory action of unbound Ptc. Furthermore, this effect is sufficient to allow normal reading of the Hh gradient in the presence of a form of Ptc that cannot bind the ligand but retains its ability to inhibit Smo. Casali and Struhl (2004) concluded that their results supported a model in which the ratio of bound to unbound Ptc molecules determines the cellular response to Hh. Chen et al. (2004) found that 2 molecules interact with mammalian Smo in an activation-dependent manner: G protein-coupled receptor kinase-2 (GRK2; 109635) leads to phosphorylation of Smo, and beta-arrestin-2 (ARRB2; 107941) fused to green fluorescent protein interacts with Smo. These 2 processes promote endocytosis of Smo in clathrin-coated pits. Ptc inhibits association of Arrb2 with Smo, and this inhibition is relieved in cells treated with Shh. A Smo agonist stimulated and a Smo antagonist (cyclopamine) inhibited both phosphorylation of Smo by Grk2 and interaction of Arrb2 with Smo. Chen et al. (2004) suggested that Arrb2 and Grk2 are thus potential mediators of signaling by activated Smo. Nagao et al. (2005) demonstrated that GLI1 (GLI; 165220) regulated PTCH expression. GLI1 induced the expression of individual PTCH transcripts in a cell type-specific manner. Nagao et al. (2005) identified several GLI1-binding sites in the PTCH promoter region, and they showed that GLI1 interacted directly with the promoter region by electrophoretic mobility shift assay and chromatin immunoprecipitation. The longer PTCH isoforms, which interacted strongly with GLI1 in vitro, induced apoptosis in transfected human embryonic kidney cells, but the shortest isoform, PTCH-S, did not. Nagao et al. (2005) determined that PTCH-S was much less stable than the longer isoforms. GENE STRUCTURE Hahn et al. (1996) defined the intron-exon boundaries of the PTC gene and reported that the PTC gene contains 23 exons spanning approximately 34 kb. They noted that there are at least 3 different forms of the PTC protein present in mammalian cells; the ancestral form and 2 human forms. The first in-frame methionine codon for one of the forms is in the third exon. The other human form of PTC contains an open reading frame that extends through to the 5-prime end and may be initiated by upstream sequences. Hahn et al. (1996) pointed out that the identification of several potential forms of the PTC protein provides a mechanism whereby a single PTC gene could play a role in different pathways. They stressed that determination of the regulation of different splice forms of PTC mRNA may shed light on the apparent role of the gene in embryonic development and growth control in adult cells. Nagao et al. (2005) determined that the PTCH gene contains 5 alternative first exons in addition to the other 22 exons. The PTCH gene covers about 70 kb. MAPPING Johnson et al. (1996) mapped the human PTC gene to chromosome 9q22.3 by radiation hybrid analysis. The mapping data of Hahn et al. (1996) placed the human PTC gene between FACC (227645) and the marker D9S287 on 9q22.3. The physical map distance between FACC and PTC is less than 650 kb, and the map distance between PTC and D9S287 is less than 290 kb. Chidambaram et al. (1996) used the Jackson Laboratory Backcross DNA panel map service to map the murine PTCH homolog, Ptc, to mouse chromosome 13. Ptc maps close to the murine Facc locus (0 recombinants in 188 meioses). They noted that mouse mutations such as flexed tail (f), purkinje cell degeneration (pcd), and mesenchymal dysplasia (mes) which involve abnormal development of skeletal and neural tissues are also located in this region of chromosome 13 and may be allelic to Ptc. MOLECULAR GENETICS Johnson et al. (1996) identified 2 mutations in the PTC coding sequence that were associated with BCNS (601309.0001 and 610309.0002). They also examined the DNA of 12 sporadic basal cell carcinomas (BCCs) and found a point mutation that resulted in a leu175-to-phe amino acid substitution in the predicted first extracellular loop of the protein. Leucine-175 is in exon 3 and is conserved in all reported ptc sequences of mouse, Drosophila, and chicken. Hahn et al. (1996) used exon sequence and SSCP to search for mutations in the PTC gene in patients with nevoid basal cell carcinoma syndrome (NBCCS). They identified 4 different germline mutations (601309.0003, 601309.0004, 601309.0005, and 601309.0006) in unrelated familial cases of NBCCS. They also identified 2 germline mutations in sporadic cases of NBCCS (601309.0007, 601309.0008). In addition, they identified 2 somatic mutations in tumor DNA derived from basal cell carcinomas. Using SSCP to screen human 'patched' in 37 sporadic BCCs in humans, Gailani et al. (1996) detected mutations in one third of the tumors. Direct sequencing of 2 BCCs without SSCP variants revealed mutations in those tumors as well, suggesting to the investigators that inactivation of 'patched' is probably a necessary step in BCC development. By Northern blots and RNA in situ hybridization Gailani et al. (1996) showed that 'patched' is expressed at high levels in tumor cells but not normal skin, suggesting that mutational inactivation of the gene leads to overexpression of mutant transcript owing to failure of a negative feedback mechanism. Nine tumors with loss of heterozygosity (LOH) had mutations of the remaining allele and 2 tumors without LOH had 2 inactivating mutations. Basal cell carcinoma is the most common cancer in humans. Epidemiologic studies had shown a correlation between exposure to sunlight and BCCs, but the association is less striking than that of squamous cell carcinoma of the skin and sunlight. In 15 of the 16 mutations identified in this study, the tumors were from sun-exposed sites. Seven mutations were typical of ultraviolet-B damage: C-T substitutions at dipyrimidine sites, including 2 CC-to-TT double-base mutations. Gailani et al. (1996) noted that the other 8 mutations, including deletions, transversion point mutations, and double-base substitutions other than CC-to-TT, can be caused by ultraviolet-B but are not UVB-specific. Wicking et al. (1997) screened 71 unrelated individuals with NBCCS for mutations in the PTCH exons. They identified 28 mutations that were distributed throughout the entire gene and predicted that 86% would cause protein truncation. Wicking et al. (1997) identified 3 families bearing identical genotypes with variable phenotypes. From this they concluded that phenotypic variability in NBCCS is a complex genetic event. No phenotype/genotype correlation between the position of the truncation mutations and major clinical features was evident. Wicking et al. (1997) concluded that the preponderance of truncation mutations in the germline of NBCCS patients suggests that the developmental defects associated with NBCCS are likely due to haploinsufficiency. They noted that studies in Drosophila indicate that developmental pathways are particularly sensitive to dosage effects, with absolute levels of certain proteins being critical to the correct functioning of such pathways. Bale (1997) reviewed factors contributing to the variable expressivity of PTCH mutations in NBCCS. He reported that clinical features of NBCCS syndrome differ more among families than between families. Shimkets et al. (1996) reported 2 patients with small interstitial deletions on chromosome 9q which involved the PTCH gene. Phenotypes of the 2 patients differed with respect to several key findings (e.g., occurrence of jaw cysts, palmar pits, and skeletal abnormalities). Bale (1997) noted that developmental defects may also arise through a 2-hit mechanism and he reviewed evidence for loss of the normal allele in epithelial cells lining jaw cysts. Bale (1997) noted the absence of genotype/phenotype correlation in NBCCS and concluded that modifying genes and germline variants resulting in hypomorphic or hypermorphic alleles may play an important role in determining the phenotype. Approximately 5% of patients with Gorlin syndrome develop medulloblastoma in the first few years of life, and 10% of patients with medulloblastoma diagnosed at age 2 years or under have Gorlin syndrome. Cowan et al. (1997) found that 1 out of 3 unrelated patients with medulloblastoma complicated by Gorlin syndrome had lost the wildtype allele on 9q, indicating that the Gorlin locus probably acts a tumor suppressor in the development of this tumor. They also confirmed this role in a basal cell carcinoma from the same individual. They suggested that Gorlin syndrome is more common than previously recognized and may not be diagnosed on clinical grounds alone even in middle life. In their Table 1 they provided diagnostic criteria for Gorlin syndrome. Five major and 6 minor criteria were listed. A positive diagnosis can be made, they suggested, on the basis of 2 major or 1 major and 2 minor criteria. Major criteria included multiple (more than 2) BCCs or 1 before age 30 years, or more than 10 basal cell nevi; any odontogenic keratocyst or polyostotic bone cyst; palmar and plantar pits; ectopic calcification; and a family history of NBCCS. Minor criteria included rib or vertebral anomalies; large head circumference with frontal bossing; cardiac or ovarian fibroma; and lymphomesenteric cysts. Falx calcification under the age of 20 years and palmar or plantar pits were among the major criteria. Studying patients who presented with multiple odontogenic keratocysts, Lench et al. (1997) identified 5 novel germline mutations in PTCH. Four mutations caused premature stop codons and 1 resulted in an amino acid substitution toward the C terminus of the predicted protein. Wicking et al. (1997) presented an additional 4 novel PTCH mutations in nevoid basal cell carcinoma syndrome, having previously reported 28 mutations. They identified 8 individuals who carried a de novo mutation in the PTCH gene. In 5 of these cases, clinical and radiologic examination had not unequivocally ruled out a diagnosis in one of the parents. On the basis of the findings in the parents, Wicking et al. (1997) presented the following review of diagnostic criteria for this syndrome: (1) although palmar and plantar pitting is pathognomonic of NBCCS, it can be falsely reported; (2) a caution must be exercised in using 'multiple BCC' as a diagnostic criterion, especially in areas of high sun exposure; (3) high arched palate, a minor diagnostic anomaly, is quite common in the general population; and (4) a dense calcification of the falx was not found in these parents, but is an almost invariable finding in adults with mutations in the PTCH gene. Aszterbaum et al. (1998) screened the 23 exons of the PTCH gene for mutations by use of single-strand conformation polymorphism analysis of DNA from 86 basal cell nevus syndrome probands, 26 sporadic basal cell carcinomas, and 7 basal cell nevus syndrome-associated basal cell carcinomas. This screen identified mutations located in 8 exons in 13 of the basal cell nevus syndrome patients and in 3 of the tumors. The most common mutations were frameshifts resulting in premature chain termination. Of 26 sporadic basal cell carcinomas screened, 11 showed loss of heterozygosity at 1 or more of the polymorphic markers examined in the PTCH gene region. Of these 11, 3 tumors were found to have PTCH gene mutations, each in a different exon of the gene. One of these was predicted to result in an amino acid substitution, 1 in a premature stop codon, and 1 in a frameshift. The latter 2 mutations caused premature chain termination. These 3 mutations were not those considered to be characteristic of UV-induced changes. Bodak et al. (1999) analyzed the PTCH gene, which had been postulated to be a tumor suppressor gene, in 22 BCCs from patients with the hyperphotosensitive genodermatosis xeroderma pigmentosum (XP; see 278700). Patients with XP are deficient in the repair of UV-induced DNA lesions and are characterized by their predisposition to cancers in sun-exposed skin. The data confirmed the presence of high levels of UV-induced mutations (C-to-T or CC-to-TT transitions), all located at the bipyrimidine sites in the PTCH gene. Moreover, in 7 of 14 (50%) BCCs from patients with XP, both PTCH and p53 (191170) were mutated. Strange et al. (2004) presented evidence that polymorphisms in the PTCH gene are associated with susceptibility to BCC. They concluded that the association was not mediated by the extent of exposure to ultraviolet radiation. Holoprosencephaly (HPE; see 236100) is the most commonly occurring congenital structural forebrain anomaly in humans. HPE is associated with mental retardation and craniofacial malformations. Considerable heterogeneity in the genetic causes of HPE has been demonstrated. One of the causes is haploinsufficiency for sonic hedgehog (SHH; 600725); see holoprosencephaly 3 (HPE3; 142945). Ming et al. (2002) hypothesized that mutations in genes encoding other components of the SHH signaling pathway could also be associated with HPE. PTCH, the receptor for SHH, normally acts to repress SHH signaling. This repression is relieved when SHH binds to PTCH. Therefore, Ming et al. (2002) analyzed PTCH as a candidate gene for HPE. They detected 4 different mutations in PTCH in 5 unrelated affected individuals. They predicted that by enhancing the repressive activity of PTCH on the SHH pathway, these mutations caused decreased SHH signaling, with resulting HPE. The mutations could affect the ability of PTCH to bind SHH or perturb the intracellular interactions of PTCH with other proteins involved in SHH signaling. The findings demonstrated further genetic heterogeneity associated with the HPE phenotype, as well as showing that mutations in different components of a single signaling pathway can result in the same clinical disorder. In the report by Ming et al. (2002), 3 of the 4 families studied had an asymptomatic parent with normal cognitive function who carried the same mutation as the offspring with holoprosencephaly. Ming et al. (2002) quoted Cohen (1989), who estimated that approximately one-third of obligate carriers of autosomal dominant forms of HPE are asymptomatic with normal cognitive function. ANIMAL MODEL Goodrich et al. (1997) investigated the function of the ptc gene by inactivating the gene in mice by homologous recombination in ES cells. Mice homozygous for the mutation died during embryogenesis and were found to have open and overgrown neural tubes. Two sonic hedgehog (Shh) target genes, ptc itself and Gli (165220), were derepressed in the ectoderm and mesoderm but not in the endoderm. Shh targets that are, under normal conditions, transcribed ventrally were aberrantly expressed in dorsal and lateral neural tube cells. Goodrich et al. (1997) concluded that ptc is essential for repression of genes that are locally activated by Shh. Mice heterozygous for the ptch mutation were larger than normal, and a subset of them developed hind limb defects (including extra digits, syndactyly and soft tissue tumors) or cerebellar medulloblastomas, abnormalities also seen in patients with the basal cell nevus syndrome. The authors speculated that their failure to observe basal cell carcinomas in the heterozygous mice may have been because somatic inactivation of the second ptc gene is required as it is in human basal cell carcinomas. Black et al. (2003) showed that PtchlacZ +/- mice exhibited vitreoretinal abnormalities resembling those found in BCNS patients. The retinas of PtchlacZ +/- mice exhibited abnormal cell cycle regulation, which culminated in photoreceptor dysplasia and Muller cell-derived gliosis. In BCNS, the intraretinal glial response results in epiretinal membrane (ERM) formation, a proliferative and contractile response on the retinal surface. ERMs can cause significant visual loss in the general, especially elderly, population. Black et al. (2003) hypothesized that alteration of Muller cell Hh signaling may play a role in the pathogenesis of such age-related 'idiopathic' ERMs.

comment: To identify candidate genes for branchiootorenal (BOR) syndrome (113650), Gu et al. (1996) made use of a set of cosmids that map to 8q13.3, the region involved in that syndrome. Cosmids were used as genomic clones to isolate corresponding cDNAs. One cDNA clone was found to have 89% sequence similarity to the B22 subunit of bovine NADH-ubiquinone oxidoreductase (GenBank X64836), a mitochondrial protein in the respiratory electron transport chain. The human cDNA encodes a 179-amino acid polypeptide sharing 90.5% similarity with the bovine sequence. Because other mitochondrial enzyme mutations have been implicated in hearing loss syndromes (e.g., 520000), Gu et al. (1996) suggested that this is a strong candidate for involvement in BOR. Lin et al. (1999) described the genomic structure of the NDUFB9 gene, including the nucleotide sequence, organization, and boundaries of the 4 coding exons. They found no mutations in the NDUFB9 gene in 9 BOR syndrome families that did not show mutations in the EYA1 gene (601653). By radiation hybrid analysis, Emahazion et al. (1998) mapped the NDUFB9 gene to 8q24.21. Smeitink and van den Heuvel (1999) reviewed the available molecular data regarding the human nuclear-encoding complex I subunits.

comment: CLONING Glial cell line-derived neurotrophic factor (GDNF; 600837) is a potent neurotrophic factor that affects several types of neurons from both the central and peripheral nervous systems. Jing et al. (1996) reported the expression cloning and characterization of rat GDNFR-alpha, a glycosylphosphatidylinositol-linked cell surface receptor for GDNF. They used the rat cDNA to isolate cDNAs corresponding to the human gene, encoding a deduced 465-amino acid polypeptide that shares 93% sequence identity with the rat protein. The authors showed that recombinant GDNFR bound GDNF specifically and mediated activation of the RET protein-tyrosine kinase (RET; 164761). They noted that loss-of-function mutations in RET are involved in Hirschsprung disease (142623), which is characterized by the congenital absence of parasympathetic innervation of the lower intestinal tract. Targeted disruption of the RET protooncogene in mice results in renal agenesis or severe dysgenesis and lack of enteric neurons throughout the digestive tract. This phenotype closely resembles that of GDNF knockout mice, suggesting that both RET and GDNF are involved in signal transduction pathways critical to the development of the kidney and the enteric nervous system. Jing et al. (1996) proposed a model for the stepwise formation of GDNF signal-transducing complex, including GDNF, GDNFR-alpha, and the RET protein-tyrosine kinase. GENE FUNCTION Paratcha et al. (2001) showed that GFRA1 is released by neuronal cells, Schwann cells, and injured sciatic nerve. RET stimulation in trans by soluble or immobilized GFRA1 potentiates downstream signaling, neurite outgrowth, and neuronal survival, and elicits dramatic localized expansions of axons and growth cones. Soluble GFRA1 mediates robust recruitment of RET to lipid rafts via a mechanism requiring the RET tyrosine kinase. Activated RET associates with different adaptor proteins inside and outside lipid rafts. The authors concluded that these results provide an explanation of the tissue distribution of GFRA1, supporting the physiologic importance of RET activation in trans as a mechanism to potentiate and diversify the biologic responses to GDNF (600837). Using gene expression profiling, Iwashita et al. (2003) determined that genes associated with Hirschsprung disease were highly upregulated in rat gut neural crest stem cells relative to whole-fetus RNA. The genes with highest expression were GDNF, SOX10 (602229), GFRA1, and EDNRB (131244). The highest expression was seen in RET, which was found to be necessary for neural crest stem cell migration in the gut. GDNF promoted the migration of neural crest stem cells in culture but did not affect their survival or proliferation. The observations made by Iwashita et al. (2003) were confirmed by quantitative RT-PCR, flow cytometry, and functional analysis. GENE STRUCTURE Eng et al. (1998) showed that the human GFRA1 gene comprises 9 exons. Shefelbine et al. (1998) demonstrated that the GFRA1 RNA transcript is alternatively processed. MAPPING Using fluorescence in situ hybridization, Gorodinsky et al. (1997) and Eng et al. (1998) mapped the GFRA1 gene to 10q26. Shefelbine et al. (1998) mapped GFRA1 to chromosome 10q25-q26 by radiation hybrid mapping. Puliti et al. (1997) mapped the Gfra1 gene to mouse chromosome 19 in a region with known homology to human 10q24-q26. Puliti et al. (1997) commented on the possibility that GFRA1 is a candidate gene for Hirschsprung disease. NOMENCLATURE The GFR-alpha Nomenclature Committee (1997) proposed names and symbols for the GPI-linked receptors for the GDNF ligand family. GDNF and neurturin (NTN; 602018) play key roles in the control of vertebrate neuron survival and differentiation. Both signal via a multicomponent receptor system formed by a glycosyl-phosphatidylinositol (GPI)-linked ligand binding subunit (the 'alpha' component) and the receptor tyrosine kinase RET as a signaling (i.e., beta) subunit. The first member of this receptor family to be identified was GDNF receptor-alpha, which binds GDNF and mediates binding and activation of RET. The second member was shown to bind NTN and to mediate activation of RET by both NTN and GDNF. One of the designations for this protein was GDNFR-beta (601956). This nomenclature committee proposed use of the abbreviated name 'GFR-alpha-X' (GDNF family receptor alpha-X) where 'X' denotes an arabic numeral to be assigned based on the date of publication of the receptor. For example, GDNFR-alpha would become GFR-alpha-1 (GFRA1) and GDNFR-beta would be symbolized GFRA2.

comment: CLONING Stone et al. (1996) screened a rat embryonic library with the Drosophila 'Smoothened' (Smo) gene and isolated overlapping cDNA clones which encoded a protein of 794 amino acids. Subsequently they isolated a human homolog of the Drosophila Smo gene, which is 94% homologous to the rat gene. The rat and human SMO genes are 33% homologous to Drosophila Smo; in the putative transmembrane domains of the gene homology is 50%. Stone et al. (1996) reported that human and rat SMO appear to be 7-transmembrane G protein-coupled receptors with 4 glycosylation sites and a putative extracellular amino terminus 203-205 amino acids long which includes 13 cysteines and can bind a polypeptide ligand. They observed that the spatial distribution of the rat 'Patched' gene product PTC (601309) and SMO show considerable overlap in embryonic tissues. GENE STRUCTURE Xie et al. (1998) reported that the human SMOH locus occupies more than 35 kb of genomic DNA. They found that the human SMOH gene is composed of 12 exons within 24 kb of genomic DNA. Exons 1 and 2 contain 5-prime untranslated sequences, the initiation codon ATG, and the entire signal peptide. GENE FUNCTION Stone et al. (1996) carried out competitor binding, crosslinking, and coprecipitation studies and demonstrated that there was no evidence that Smo acted as a receptor for Shh (600725), the Sonic hedgehog gene product. They demonstrated that an epitope-tagged N-terminal Shh peptide binds specifically to mouse Ptc (601309). They also showed that Ptc and Smo form a complex to which Shh binds. Stone et al. (1996) noted that genetic mutations leading to a truncated or unstable Ptc protein are associated with the familial or sporadic form of basal cell carcinoma (BCC). This finding, combined with the fact that Ptc is a high-affinity binding protein for Shh, suggests that the Hedgehog system may provide mitogenic or differentiative signals to basal cells in the skin throughout life. Stone et al. (1996) raised the possibility that BCNS (109400) and BCC might result from constitutive activation of SMO, which then becomes oncogenic after its release from inhibition by PTC. On the basis of their studies in Drosophila, Chen and Struhl (1996) presented evidence that Ptc acts as a receptor for Hedgehog (Hh) proteins. They suggested a novel signal transduction mechanism in which Hh proteins bind to Ptc or to a Ptc-Smo complex and thereby induce Smo activity. Taipale et al. (2002) reported that Ptc and Smo are not significantly associated with hedgehog-responsive cells and that free Ptc (unbound by hedgehog) acts substoichiometrically to suppress Smo activity and thus is critical in specifying the level of pathway activity. Patched is a 12-transmembrane protein with homology to bacterial proton-driven transmembrane molecular transporters. Taipale et al. (2002) demonstrated that the function of Ptc is impaired by alterations of residues that are conserved in and required for function of these bacterial transporters. Taipale et al. (2002) suggested that the Ptc tumor suppressor functions normally as a transmembrane molecular transporter, which acts indirectly to inhibit Smo activity, possibly through changes in distribution or concentration of a small molecule. Chen et al. (2004) found that 2 molecules interact with mammalian Smo in an activation-dependent manner: G protein-coupled receptor kinase-2 (GRK2; 109635) leads to phosphorylation of Smo, and beta-arrestin-2 (ARRB2; 107941) fused to green fluorescent protein interacts with Smo. These 2 processes promote endocytosis of Smo in clathrin-coated pits. Ptc inhibits association of Arrb2 with Smo, and this inhibition is relieved in cells treated with Shh. A Smo agonist stimulated and a Smo antagonist (cyclopamine) inhibited both phosphorylation of Smo by Grk2 and interaction of Arrb2 with Smo. Chen et al. (2004) suggested that Arrb2 and Grk2 are thus potential mediators of signaling by activated Smo. Jia et al. (2004) showed that PKA (see 188830) and casein kinase I (CKI; 600505) regulate Smo cell surface accumulation and activity in response to hedgehog (Hh; see Shh, 600725). Blocking PKA or CKI activity in the Drosophila wing disc prevented Hh-induced Smo accumulation and attenuated pathway activity, whereas increasing PKA activity promoted Smo accumulation and pathway activation. Jia et al. (2004) showed that PKA and CKI phosphorylate Smo at several sites, and that phosphorylation-deficient forms of Smo fail to accumulate on the cell surface and are unable to transduce the Hh signal. Conversely, phosphorylation-mimicking Smo variants showed constitutive cell surface expression and signaling activity. Furthermore, Jia et al. (2004) found that the levels of Smo cell surface expression and activity correlated with its levels of phosphorylation. Jia et al. (2004) concluded that Hh induces progressive Smo phosphorylation by PKA and CKI, leading to elevation of Smo cell surface levels and signaling activity. Corbit et al. (2005) showed that mammalian Smo is expressed on the primary cilium. This ciliary expression is regulated by Hh pathway activity; Shh or activating mutations in Smo promoted ciliary localization, whereas the Smo antagonist cyclopomine inhibited ciliary localization. They showed that the translocation of Smo to primary cilia depends upon a conserved hydrophobic and basic residue sequence homologous to a domain shown to be required for the ciliary localization of 7-transmembrane proteins in C. elegans. Mutation of this domain not only prevented ciliary localization but also eliminated Smo activity both in cultured cells and in zebrafish embryos. Thus, Corbit et al. (2005) concluded that Hh-dependent translocation to cilia is essential for Smo activity, suggesting that Smo acts at the primary cilium. MAPPING By fluorescence in situ hybridization (FISH), Quirk et al. (1997) mapped the human SMOH gene to 7q32. By the same method, Xie et al. (1998) mapped the gene to 7q31-q32. By FISH and radiation hybrid analysis, Sublett et al. (1998) refined the localization to 7q32.3. BIOCHEMICAL FEATURES Basal cell carcinoma, medulloblastoma, rhabdomyosarcoma, and other human tumors are associated with mutations that activate the protooncogene 'Smoothened' or that inactivate the tumor suppressor 'Patched.' Smoothened and Patched mediate the cellular response to the Hedgehog secreted protein signal, and oncogenic mutations affecting these proteins cause excess activity of the Hedgehog response pathway. Taipale et al. (2000) showed that the plant-derived teratogen cyclopamine, which inhibits the Hedgehog response, is a potential mechanism-based therapeutic agent for treatment of these tumors. Taipale et al. (2000) showed that cyclopamine or synthetic derivatives with improved potency block activation of the Hedgehog response pathway and abnormal cell growth associated with both types of oncogenic mutation. Taipale et al. (2000) concluded that cyclopamine may act by influencing the balance between active and inactive forms of Smoothened. MOLECULAR GENETICS Basal cell carcinomas are the commonest human cancer. Insight into their genesis came from identification of mutations in the Patched gene in patients with the basal cell nevus syndrome, a hereditary disease characterized by multiple basal cell carcinomas and by developmental abnormalities. The binding of sonic hedgehog to its receptor, PTCH, is thought to prevent normal inhibition by PTCH of smoothened (SMOH), a 7-transmembrane protein. According to this model, the inhibition of SMOH signaling is relieved following mutational inactivation of PTCH in basal cell nevus syndrome. Xie et al. (1998) identified activating somatic missense mutations in the SMOH gene itself in sporadic basal cell carcinomas from 3 patients. The mutant SMOH, unlike wildtype, can cooperate with adenovirus E1A to transform rat embryonic fibroblast cells in culture. Furthermore, skin abnormalities similar to basal cell carcinomas developed in transgenic murine skin overexpressing mutant SMOH. These findings support the role of SMOH as a signaling component of the SHH-receptor complex and provide direct evidence that mutated SMOH can function as an oncogene in basal cell carcinomas. ANIMAL MODEL To gain insight into the role of SMO in Hedgehog signaling in vertebrates, Zhang et al. (2001) generated a null allele of Smo by gene targeting in mouse embryonic stem (ES) cells. They showed that Smo acts epistatic to Ptc1 to mediate Shh and Ihh (600726) signaling in the early mouse embryo. Smo and Shh/Ihh compound mutants had identical phenotypes: embryos failed to turn, arresting at somite stages with a small, linear heart tube, an open gut, and cyclopia. The absence of visible left/right (L/R) asymmetry led the authors to examine the pathways controlling L/R situs. Zhang et al. (2001) presented evidence consistent with a model in which Hedgehog signaling within the node is required for activation of GDF1 (602880) and induction of left-side determinants. Further, they demonstrated an absolute requirement for Hedgehog signaling in sclerotomal development and a role in cardiac morphogenesis. Wilbanks et al. (2004) showed that the functional knockdown of Arrb2 in zebrafish embryos recapitulates the many phenotypes of Hedgehog pathway mutants. Expression of wildtype Arrb2, or constitutive activation of the Hedgehog pathway downstream of Smo, rescues the phenotypes caused by Arrb2 deficiency. These results suggested to Wilbanks et al. (2004) that a functional interaction between Arrb2 and Smo may be critical to regulate Hedgehog signaling in zebrafish development.

comment: CLONING Pfeifer et al. (1996) noted that there are 2 forms of cGMP-dependent protein kinase (cGK), types I (see 176894) and II, which are encoded by distinct genes. Smooth muscle, platelets, and cerebellum contain high concentrations of cGKI, whereas cGKII is highly concentrated in brain, lung, and intestinal mucosa. Orstavik et al. (1996) cloned a human cDNA encoding type II cGK by using the mouse type II cGK cDNA to probe a cerebellum cDNA library. The 762-amino acid human type II cGK protein is 96% identical to the mouse and rat type II cGK proteins. Human type II cGK is expressed as a 6-kb mRNA in prostate, small intestine, and colon and as a 4.4-kb mRNA in thymus and prostate. MAPPING By PCR and Southern blot analysis of somatic cell hybrid panels, Orstavik et al. (1996) mapped the human type II cGK gene to chromosome 4q13.1-q21.1. ANIMAL MODEL Pfeifer et al. (1996) noted that evidence has suggested that cGKII mediates intestinal secretion of water and electrolytes induced by the E. coli toxin STa and the intestinal peptide guanylin (139392). To investigate the physiologic roles of cGKII, Pfeifer et al. (1996) engineered a homozygous null mutation of the gene in mice by gene targeting. Mice deficient in cGKII were resistant to E. coli STa and developed dwarfism that was caused by a severe defect in endochondral ossification at the growth plates. Membranous ossification was unaffected. Immunohistochemical staining showed a predominant expression of cGKII in the late proliferative and early hypertrophic chondrocytes of the growth plate. Pfeifer et al. (1996) performed experiments with explanted bones from mutant and normal mice showing that the growth defect was intrinsic to the bone and not due to a general metabolic disturbance. The results indicated to the authors the central role played by cGKII in diverse physiologic processes. Pfeifer et al. (1996) stated that identification of the pathway that mediates intestinal fluid secretion by E. coli STa has potential medical implications because STa causes traveler's diarrhea and about 50% of infant mortality in developing countries. Komeda miniature rat Ishikawa (KMI) is a naturally occurring rat mutant with an autosomal recessive mutation (mri). Homozygous KMI rats (mri/mri) grow normally until 3 to 4 weeks of age, but then gradually develop longitudinal growth retardation without other organ abnormalities. Chikuda et al. (2004) found that KMI rats carry a 5-kb deletion that removes exons 4 and 5 of the cGKII gene, resulting in a frameshift and a cGKII protein with amino acid substitutions and a premature stop codon prior to the C-terminal kinase domain. They found that expression of Sox9 (608160), which is normally downregulated in postmitotic chondrocytes, persisted in the nuclei of KMI growth plate chondrocytes. Transfection experiments in human cells revealed that cGKII phosphorylates SOX9 and attenuates SOX9 function by inhibiting its nuclear entry. Furthermore, the impaired differentiation of cultured KMI chondrocytes was restored by silencing Sox9 by RNA interference. Chikuda et al. (2004) concluded that cGKII is a molecular switch that couples the cessation of proliferation and the start of hypertrophic chondrocyte differentiation through attenuating SOX9 function.

comment: DESCRIPTION The testis-determining gene SRY (480000) encodes a transcription factor characterized by a DNA-binding motif known as the HMG (high mobility group) domain. The SOX gene family consists of genes related to SRY, with a sequence identity of more than 60% to the SRY HMG box. See 600898. CLONING Greenfield et al. (1996) described a novel member of the mouse Sox gene family, Sox18, which is transcribed in adult lung and in cardiac and skeletal muscle. They reported that the Sox18 protein binds the sequence AACAAAG in vitro and that it is capable of transactivating gene expression. Pennisi et al. (2000) found that Sox18 is expressed in the developing vascular endothelium and hair follicles in mouse embryos. By EST database searching for sequences with an HMG-box, followed by 3-prime and 5-prime RACE, Azuma et al. (2000) identified a partial cDNA sequence which they then used to screen a human heart cDNA library. They isolated a cDNA clone encoding a deduced 384-amino acid protein that shares 83% identity with the mouse Sox18 protein. Northern blot analysis showed that a 1.9-kb SOX18 transcript is predominantly expressed in the heart, although weak signals are seen in brain, liver, testis, and leukocytes. MAPPING On the basis of linkage analysis, Greenfield et al. (1996) mapped the Sox18 gene to distal mouse chromosome 2. They noted that distal mouse chromosome 2 includes 1 of 10 known imprinted regions in the mouse. By homology, the human SOX18 gene would map to chromosome 20q. By PCR-based analyses with both a human/rodent monochromosomal hybrid cell panel and a radiation hybrid panel, Azuma et al. (2000) mapped the SOX18 gene to 20q13.33. Pennisi et al. (2000) also confirmed the assignment of the SOX18 gene to 20q13.3 by radiation hybrid analysis. MOLECULAR GENETICS Using microsatellite analysis in 3 families with hypotrichosis-lymphedema-telangiectasia syndrome (HLTS; 607823), Irrthum et al. (2003) excluded the VEGFR3 (136352) and FOXC2 (602402) genes, which are related to other disorders involving lymphedema, as candidate genes. They identified the murine 'ragged' phenotype, which is caused by mutation in the Sox18 gene, as a likely counterpart of HLTS because it presents a combination of hair and cardiovascular anomalies, including symptoms of lymphatic dysfunction. By sequencing the SOX18 gene in the 3 HLTS families, they identified homozygous missense mutations (601618.0001 and 601618.0002) in affected members of 2 consanguineous families and a heterozygous nonsense mutation (601618.0003) in an affected child and his brother, who died in utero with hydrops fetalis, of a nonconsanguineous family. The nonsense mutation, which truncated the SOX18 protein in its transactivation domain, was not found in genomic DNA from either parent and was thought to constitute a de novo germline mutation. ANIMAL MODEL Greenfield et al. (1996) noted that Sox18 is a candidate for 2 mouse mutants, 'ragged' and 'wasting.' 'Ragged' heterozygous mice are viable and healthy with thin ragged coats comprised of guard hairs and awls. Homozygotes almost completely lack vibrissae and coat hairs, display generalized edema and cyanosis, rarely survive past weaning, and, depending on the genetic background, may have an accumulation of chyle in the peritoneum. Ragged(J) mice have a phenotype indistinguishable from that of ragged mice. The ragged mutation is semidominant. Pennisi et al. (2000) identified mutations in the Sox18 gene that underlie the cardiovascular and hair follicle defects in ragged mice. The ragged phenotype is caused by deletion of a cytosine at nucleotide 960 of the murine Sox18 gene; ragged(J) is caused by deletion of a guanine at nucleotide 959. Fusion proteins containing these mutations lacked the ability to activate transcription relative to wildtype controls in an in vitro assay.

comment: CLONING By positional cloning in the 8q13.3 region where the branchiootorenal dysplasia syndrome (BOR; 113650) maps, Abdelhak et al. (1997) identified a gene that they showed to be responsible for the disorder. The gene is a human homolog of the Drosophila 'eyes absent' gene (Eya) and was therefore called EYA1. The gene encodes a deduced 559-amino acid polypeptide with a predicted molecular mass of 61.2 kD. GENE FUNCTION Abdelhak et al. (1997) studied the expression pattern of the mouse EYA1 ortholog and obtained results suggesting a role in the development of all components of the inner ear, from the emergence of the otic placode. In the developing kidney, the expression pattern indicated a role for Eya1 in the metanephric cells surrounding the 'just-divided' ureteric branches. Xu et al. (1997) showed that in the limbs of 10.5-day mouse embryos, Eya1 expression was largely restricted to the flexor tendons, whereas Eya2 (601654) was expressed in the extensor tendons and probably also in the ligaments of the phalanges. They demonstrated that the proline/serine/threonine-rich N-terminal regions of the protein products of the Eya1, Eya2, and Eya3 (601655) genes have transcriptional activator activity. These results supported a role for the Eya genes in connective tissue patterning in the limbs. Azuma et al. (2000) stated that in Drosophila, the Eya gene is involved in the formation of compound eyes. Flies with loss-of-function mutations of this gene develop no eyes and form ectopic eyes in the antennae and the ventral zone of the head on target expression. A highly conserved homologous gene in various invertebrates and vertebrates has been shown to function in the formation of the eye. Using sequence analysis, Hsiao et al. (2001) identified 2 conserved mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) sites in the EYA1 sequence. In vivo genetic analysis, together with in vitro kinase assay results, demonstrated that Eya is a substrate for extracellular signal-regulated kinase, the MAPK acting downstream in the receptor tyrosine kinase (RTK) signaling pathway. Hsiao et al. (2001) hypothesized that phosphorylation of Drosophila Eya provides a direct regulatory link between the RTK/Ras/MAPK signaling cascade and the retinal determination gene network. They concluded that Eya function in Drosophila is positively regulated by MAPK-mediated phosphorylation. Buller et al. (2001) analyzed the functional importance of Eya domain missense mutations with respect to protein complex formation and cellular localization. Previously described point mutations did not alter protein localization; however, 3 mutations (glu330 to lys, 601653.0009; ser454 to pro, 601653.0012; and leu472 to arg, 601653.0013) disrupted interactions between Eya and the sine oculis homeobox protein (Six1; 601125) in both yeast and mammalian cells. Binding to Six2 (604994) was not impeded. Rayapureddi et al. (2003) demonstrated that Eya is a protein-tyrosine phosphatase in Drosophila. It does not resemble the classical tyrosine phosphatases that use cysteine as a nucleophile and proceed by means of a thiol-phosphate intermediate. Rather, Eya is the prototype for a class of protein-tyrosine phosphatases that use a nucleophilic aspartic acid in a metal-dependent reaction. Furthermore, Rayapureddi et al. (2003) showed that the phosphatase activity of Eya contributes to its ability to induce eye formation in Drosophila. Tootle et al. (2003) independently showed that Eya belongs to the phosphatase subgroup of the haloacid dehalogenase (HAD) superfamily, and proposed a function for it as a non-thiol-based protein-tyrosine phosphatase. Experiments performed in cultured Drosophila cells and in vitro indicated that Eya has intrinsic protein-tyrosine phosphatase activity and can autocatalytically dephosphorylate itself. Confirming the biologic significance of this function, mutations that disrupt the phosphatase active site severely compromise the ability of Eya to promote eye specification and development in Drosophila. Tootle et al. (2003) concluded that given the functional importance of phosphorylation-dependent modulation of transcription factor activity, this evidence for a nuclear transcriptional coactivator with intrinsic phosphatase activity suggests an unanticipated method of fine-tuning transcriptional regulation. Grifone et al. (2004) found that among the Six and Eya gene products expressed in mouse skeletal muscle, Six1 and Eya1 accumulated preferentially in the nuclei of fast-twitch muscles. Forced coexpression of Six1 and Eya1 in the slow-twitch soleus muscle induced a transition to a fast-twitch fiber type, with activation of fast-twitch fiber-specific genes and a switch toward glycolytic metabolism. GENE STRUCTURE Abdelhak et al. (1997) reported the complete genomic structure of the EYA1 gene. The gene consists of 16 coding exons and extends over 156 kb. It encodes various alternatively spliced transcripts differing only in their 5-prime regions. MOLECULAR GENETICS To test for possible DNA rearrangements within EYA1 in BOR probands, Abdelhak et al. (1997) hybridized Southern blots containing DNA from 21 familial and sporadic patients with probes corresponding to exons A to G of the gene and the exon immediately adjacent to exon A (designated exon z). In a sporadic case of BOR, hybridization with exon D resulted in a signal of reduced intensity, suggesting a deletion; this reduction was not seen in the proband's parents. Hybridization with exons A and B resulted in signals of normal intensity, C resulted in a band shift, and E, F, and G resulted in bands of reduced intensity. It was estimated that the deletion in this individual spanned 5.8 to 7 kb. In another patient, Abdelhak et al. (1997) detected a premature stop codon in exon z (601653.0001); in a third patient, replacement of a T with CC insertion was detected in exon D (601653.0002). The affected family members of these 2 probands carried the same mutations, whereas the unaffected family members did not. In a fourth patient, a 1-bp insertion was detected in exon c. The phenotypically normal parent of this proband did not carry this mutation. In each of 4 other individuals, a mutation was detected. Abdelhak et al. (1997) performed sequence analysis of the entire EYA1 coding region for 20 unrelated patients affected by BOR syndrome, and 6 novel mutations were identified. Sequence analysis of the coding region, including splice site junctions, as well as Southern blot analysis of the coding region and the 5-prime and 3-prime untranslated regions (UTRs), failed to detect anomalies in 14 of the 20 patients. Among these 14 patients, 10 represented familial cases, and, for 6 of them, linkage analysis was consistent with the involvement of EYA1. Since no evidence for genetic heterogeneity had been reported, Abdelhak et al. (1997) assumed that, for these 14 patients, the mutations were located either in the promoter region, within an intron, in the 3-prime UTR, or in the most 5-prime sequences which had not yet been studied extensively. This report brought the total number of mutations detected in BOR patients to 14; all of them were different. A common feature of the mutations, however, was their location within or in the immediate vicinity of the eyaHR (also called Eya box). The region of clustering of mutations represents half of the coding sequence. Mutations outside this domain may give rise to either a lethal defect or to a discrete undetected phenotype. Abdelhak et al. (1997) favored the latter hypothesis for the following reasons: 1 of the 2 patients carrying a deletion of the whole gene was exclusively affected by the BO syndrome (Haan et al., 1989), and the only mutation that had been detected outside the eyaHR was also present in a BOR-affected patient (601653.0004). To address the question of whether the branchiootic syndrome (BO) is the same as branchiootorenal dysplasia, Vincent et al. (1997) studied 2 large kindreds in each of which 8 affected members presented exclusively with BO syndrome (without the association of renal anomalies). In both kindreds, linkage analysis mapped the causative gene to the same chromosomal region as the EYA1 gene. A search for mutations in 9 of the EYA1 coding exons identified a 2-bp insertion (601653.0003) segregating in 1 family, and an 8-bp deletion (601053.0004) segregating in the other. Thus, the BOR and BO syndromes are allelic defects in the EYA1 gene. Kumar et al. (1998) identified 3 novel mutations in the EYA1 gene in patients with the BOR syndrome, 1 of which was a 4-bp deletion in a family originally reported by Rowley (1969). Kumar et al. (1998) found reports of 20 mutations in the EYA1 gene, most of them clustered in the C-terminal region (exons 9 to 16), in cases of BOR syndrome. Rickard et al. (2000) identified mutations in 11 of 18 individuals with classic BOR. They found no mutations in individuals with atypical BOR syndrome or OFC syndrome. The mutations identified were clustered in exons 9 to 16 with 3 in exon 8 and 1 in exon 5. Azuma et al. (2000) examined genomic DNA isolated from patients with various types of developmental eye anomalies for EYA1 mutations by the use of PCR-SSCP and sequencing. They identified 3 novel missense mutations in patients who had congenital cataracts and ocular anterior segment anomalies. One of the patients had clinical features of BOR syndrome as well. These results implied that the human EYA1 gene is also involved in eye morphogenesis, and that a wide variety of clinical manifestations may be caused by EYA mutations. Mutations were heterozygous in all 3 probands; 2 of the 3 were sporadic. Vervoort et al. (2002) noted that in up to one-half of reported cases of BOR syndrome, EYA1 screening was negative, suggesting genetic heterogeneity. Using SSCP and direct sequencing, they screened the coding region of the EYA1 gene in a panel of BOR families linked to chromosome 8. Only 1 point mutation in 5 probands was detected. However, using Southern blot analysis, complex rearrangements such as inversions and large deletions were identified in the other 4 patients. Vervoort et al. (2002) concluded that more complex rearrangements may have been missed in earlier studies, which commonly used only SSCP and sequencing for mutation detection. Chang et al. (2004) sought to refine the clinical diagnosis of BOR syndrome by analyzing phenotypic data from families segregating EYA1 disease-causing mutations. Based on genotype-phenotype analyses, they proposed new criteria for the clinical diagnosis of BOR syndrome. The authors found that in approximately 40% of patients meeting their criteria, EYA1 mutations were identified. Of these mutations, 80% were coding sequence variants identified by SSCP, and 20% were complex genomic rearrangements identified by a semiquantitative PCR-based screen. Chang et al. (2004) concluded that genetic testing of EYA1 should include analysis of the coding sequence and a screen for complex rearrangements. Migliosi et al. (2004) used an analysis based on denaturing high performance liquid chromatography (DHPLC) to identify 5 novel mutations in the EYA1 gene associated with BOR syndrome. Rickard et al. (2001) presented evidence that the otofaciocervical (OFC) syndrome (166780) is a contiguous gene deletion syndrome involving the EYA1 gene, which is the site of mutations causing the branchiootorenal syndrome. They speculated that the differences between the 2 syndromes might be related to undefined genes included in the deleted region accounting for additional traits seen in OFC. Estefania et al. (2005) reported a patient with a splice site mutation in the EYA1 gene (601653.0014) and clinical changes thought to be characteristic of OFC, namely, alterations of the face and shoulder girdle in addition to malformations seen in BOR. ANIMAL MODEL Johnson et al. (1999) described a spontaneous mutation causing deafness and circling behavior in a C3H/HeJ colony of mice. Pathologic analysis of mutant mice showed gross morphologic abnormalities of the inner ear, and also dysmorphic or missing kidneys. The deafness and abnormal behavior were shown to be inherited as an autosomal recessive trait, and were mapped to chromosome 1, near the position of the Eya1 gene (Xu et al., 1997). Molecular analysis of the Eya1 gene in mutant mice revealed insertion of an intracisternal A particle (IAP) element in intron 7. The presence of the IAP insertion was associated with reduced expression of the normal Eya1 message and formation of additional aberrant transcripts. The hypomorphic nature of the mutation may explain its recessive inheritance, if protein levels in homozygotes, but not heterozygotes, are below a critical threshold needed for normal developmental function. Johnson et al. (1999) designated the new mouse mutation Eya1(bor) to denote that it appears to be an authentic model of the human BOR syndrome. In mice, Floyd et al. (2003) studied the modifier-of-vibrator-1 locus (Mvb1), which controls levels of correctly processed mRNA from genes mutated by endogenous retrovirus insertions into introns, such as occurs in the Eya1(BOR) model of human branchiootorenal syndrome. By positional complementation cloning, they identified Mvb1 as the nuclear export factor Nxf1 (602647), providing an unexpected link between the mRNA export receptor and pre-mRNA processing. To understand the developmental pathogenesis of organs affected in BOR syndrome and BO syndrome, Xu et al. (1999) inactivated the Eya1 gene in mice. Eya1 heterozygotes showed renal abnormalities and a conductive hearing loss similar to BOR syndrome, whereas Eya1 homozygotes lacked ears and kidneys due to defective inductive tissue interactions and apoptotic regression of the organ primordia. Inner ear development in Eya1 homozygotes arrested at the otic vesicle stage, and all components of the inner ear and specific cranial sensory ganglia failed to form. In the kidney, Eya1 homozygosity resulted in an absence of ureteric bud outgrowth and a subsequent failure of metanephric induction. Gdnf (600837) expression, which is required to direct ureteric bud outgrowth via activation of the RET receptor tyrosine kinase (164761), was not detected in Eya1 -/- metanephric mesenchyme. In Eya1 -/- ear and kidney development, Six (see SIX1; 601205) but not Pax (see PAX2; 167409) expression was Eya1 dependent, similar to a genetic pathway elucidated in the Drosophila eye imaginal disc. The results indicated that EYA1 controls critical early inductive signaling events involved in ear and kidney formation, and integrated EYA1 into the genetic regulatory cascade controlling kidney formation upstream of GDNF. In addition, the results suggested that an evolutionarily conserved PAX-EYA-SIX regulatory hierarchy is used in mammalian ear and kidney development. Li et al. (2003) reported that Six1 is required for the development of murine kidney, muscle, and inner ear and that it exhibits synergistic genetic interactions with Eya factors. Li et al. (2003) demonstrated that the Eya family has a protein phosphatase function, and that its enzymatic activity is required for regulating genes encoding growth control and signaling molecules, modulating precursor cell proliferation. The phosphatase function of Eya switches the function of Six1-Dach (603803) from repression to activation, causing transcriptional activation through recruitment of coactivators. The gene-specific recruitment of a coactivator with intrinsic phosphatase activity provides a molecular mechanism for activation of specific gene targets, including those regulating precursor cell proliferation and survival in mammalian organogenesis. Eya1 +/- Six1 +/- double heterozygous mice had a defect in kidney development, which was not observed in single heterozygotes for either gene deletion, suggesting that Six1 and Eya1 act in the same genetic pathway. Notably, there was a complete absence of all hypaxial muscle in Six1 -/- Eya1 -/- double knockout mice and severe reduction of epaxial muscle, a phenotype resembling that seen in mice homozygous for deletion of Myog (159980) and in double knockouts for MyoD (159970)/Myf5 (159990) and Pax3 (606597)/Myf5. Interestingly, although mutation of Six1 or Eya1 has minimal or no effect on pituitary development, mice with both genes deleted have a pituitary that is approximately 5- to 10-fold smaller by volume than the wildtype gland.

comment: CLONING Abdelhak et al. (1997) identified, by positional cloning, a gene at 8q13.3 that contains mutations in patients with branchiootorenal dysplasia (BOR; 113650). The gene is a human homolog of the Drosophila 'eyes absent' (eya), and was therefore called EYA1 (601653). A highly conserved 271-amino acid C-terminal region was also found in the products of 2 other human genes that were subsequently called EYA2 and EYA3 (601655), demonstrating the existence of a novel gene family. Some of these other members of the EYA gene family may underlie developmental defects, because Abdelhak et al. (1997) demonstrated that all 3 of these genes are expressed in the ninth week of human development. Gene identification strategies that rely on cross-species comparison are based on the observation that functionally significant regions of the genome are highly conserved during evolution. Banfi et al. (1996) applied the power of Drosophila genetics to the vast resource of human cDNAs represented in the expressed sequence tag (EST) database to identify novel human genes of biologic interest. One human cDNA showing significant homology to the gene causing the Drosophila mutant phenotype 'clift' ('eyes absent') and was reported by Abdelhak et al. (1997) to be the EYA2 gene. GENE FUNCTION Duncan et al. (1997) found that Eya2 shows a dynamic pattern of expression during mouse development. Its expression was first detected in 8.5-day embryos in the region of head ectoderm fated to become the forebrain. At later stages of development, Eya2 was expressed in the olfactory placode and in a variety of neural crest derivatives. In the eye, expression of Eya2 was first detected after formation of the lens vesicle. At day 17.5, the highest level of Eya2 mRNA was observed in primary lens fibers. Low levels of Eya2 expression were detected in retina, sclera, and cornea. Duncan et al. (1997) stated that, although Eya2 is expressed relatively late in eye development, it belongs to a growing list of factors that may be essential for eye development among metazoan phyla. Like members of the PAX6 gene family (see 607108), 'eyes absent' gene family members were probably first involved in functions not related to vision, with recruitment for visual system formation and function occurring later. Xu et al. (1997) showed that in the limbs of 10.5-day mouse embryos, Eya1 expression was largely restricted to the flexor tendons, whereas Eya2 was expressed in the extensor tendons and probably also in the ligaments of the phalanges. They demonstrated that the proline/serine/threonine-rich N-terminal regions of the protein products of the Eya1, Eya2, and Eya3 genes have transcriptional activator activity. These results supported a role for the Eya genes in connective tissue patterning in the limbs. Ridgeway and Skerjanc (2001) induced myogenesis in a mouse pluripotent stem cell line. Myogenesis was associated with increased expression of Pax3 (606597), followed by expression of the transcription factor Six1 (601205), its cofactor Eya2, and the transcription factor Mox1 (600147), prior to the induction of MyoD (159970) and myogenin (159980) expression. MAPPING Banfi et al. (1996) mapped the human gene to 20q13.1 using both fluorescence in situ hybridization and radiation hybrid mapping. Zimmerman et al. (1997) mapped the mouse Eya2 gene to chromosome 2 in a region syntenic with human 20q13. Duncan et al. (1997) likewise mapped EYA2 to human 20q13.1 and Eya2 to mouse chromosome 2.

comment: Abdelhak et al. (1997) identified 3 members of a novel family homologous to Drosophila 'eyes absent' gene (eya). One of these, EYA1 (601653), was demonstrated to be mutant in cases of branchiootorenal dysplasia (BOR; 113650). EYA2 (601654) and EYA3, like EYA1, are expressed in the ninth week of human development and may also underlie developmental defects. Xu et al.

(1997) mapped the murine Eya3 gene to mouse chromosome 4 in the region syntenic with human 1p36. In the mouse, no recombination was detected between the Eya3 gene and the gene encoding the oncogene FGR (164940) which is located on 1p36.2-p36.1. By fluorescence in situ hybridization, Zimmerman et al. (1997) established that the human EYA3 gene is on 1p36.

comment: A number sign (#) is used with this entry because of evidence that 1 form of the disorder is caused by mutation in the SOX10 gene (602229). Warburg et al. (1990) reported a sister and brother from Yemen with a hitherto undescribed association of microcornea, colobomata of the iris and choroidea, nystagmus, severe early hearing loss, and patchy hypo- and hyperpigmentation. They proposed that the disorder represents a new syndrome with autosomal recessive inheritance. Hennekam and Gorlin (1996) described a girl with bilateral sensorineural hearing loss, completely white anterior scalp hair, multiple freckles, and hypopigmentation of the right hand and foot and left fingers and toes. Although she did not manifest ocular defects except nystagmus, which spontaneously disappeared before 2 years of age, the authors considered this patient to have a mild form of the Yemenite (Warburg) syndrome. In the patient reported by Hennekam and Gorlin (1996), Bondurand et al. (1999) showed that a missense mutation in the SOX10 gene (S135T; 602229.0005), which resulted in a loss of DNA binding of this transcription factor, was responsible. In contrast, they found no SOX10 alteration in the other, more severely affected patients reported by Warburg et al. (1990). Thus, these 2 cases appeared to represent 2 different syndromes. Moreover, as mutations of the SOX10 transcription factor had been described in Waardenburg-Hirschsprung disease, otherwise known as Waardenburg-Shah syndrome (e.g., 602229.0001), these results showed that mutations in the SOX10 gene cause various types of neurocristopathy.

comment: DNA-binding proteins are typically involved in the developmental control of gene expression. High mobility group (HMG) proteins contain a DNA-binding motif called the HMG domain. They have been proposed to act either as target-specific transcription factors or as chromatin structure regulatory elements, or both. Jay et al. (1997) stated that more than 100 HMG-box containing proteins have been reported and classified into 2 distinct subgroups according to the sequence specificity of the DNA binding, the number of HMG DNA-binding domains, and phylogenetic considerations. The first subgroup comprises proteins that are all potential transcription factors believed to control gene expression during development. They contain only 1 DNA-binding domain and they bind to DNA in a sequence-specific fashion. The second subgroup consists of all other HMG box-containing proteins, most of which contain more than 1 DNA-binding domain and can bind to DNA in a non-sequence-specific manner. The testis-determining gene located on the Y chromosome (SRY; 480000) belongs to the first subgroup. Its cloning led to the discovery of a family of both autosomal and X-linked genes called SOX (for 'SRY-box related) because of the strong homology of their DNA-binding domain with the HMG box of SRY. Jay et al. (1997) cloned SOX22, a new human member of the SOX family that had not yet been identified in any other mammalian species. The predicted 315-amino acid protein contains several domains that are also present in other paralogous SOX proteins. They mapped the SOX22 gene to 20p13 by fluorescence in situ hybridization. It did not appear to be clustered with any other SOX gene that had been mapped up to that time. SOX22 mRNA was expressed in various fetal and adult organs and tissues, suggesting that this gene plays roles in both differentiation and maintenance of several cell types.

comment: CLONING Emoto et al. (1997) isolated a cDNA encoding a novel member of the human fibroblast growth factor family from lung. The cDNA encodes a protein of 208 amino acids with high sequence identity (95.6%) to rat FGF10, suggesting that the protein is human FGF10. Both the human and rat FGF10 have a hydrophobic N terminus of approximately 40 amino acids, which may serve as a signal sequence. Evolutionary relationships of human FGFs indicated that FGF10 is closest to FGF7 (148180); in both structure and biologic activity, FGF10 is similar to FGF7. Recombinant human FGF10, of approximately 19 kD, showed mitogenic activity for fetal rat keratinizing epidermal cells, but essentially no activity for NIH 3T3 fibroblasts. Using in situ hybridization and immunohistochemistry, Suzuki et al. (2000) detected expression of Fgf10 in the developing epidermis (17.5 dpc) and hair follicles (16.5-18.5 dpc and 11 days after birth) of normal mice. Bagai et al. (2002) cloned FGF10 by PCR of a urinary bladder cDNA library. The deduced protein contains 2 putative N-glycosylation sites, a heparin binding domain, and several putative phosphorylation sites. In situ hybridization demonstrated expression of FGF10 in fibroblasts of the lamina propria. GENE STRUCTURE Bagai et al. (2002) determined that FGF10 contains 3 exons and spans at least 52.7 kb. GENE FUNCTION Bagai et al. (2002) determined that recombinant FGF10 induced proliferation of human urothelial cells in vitro and induced proliferation of transitional epithelium of wildtype and Fgf7-null mice in vivo. Mechanistic studies with human cells indicated that FGF10 translocated into urothelial cell nuclei and initiated a signaling cascade that began with the heparin-dependent tyrosine phosphorylation of surface transmembrane receptors. Quiescent normal urothelial cells expressed negligible levels of FGF10. During proliferation, levels of FGF10 rose at the urothelial cell surface and/or within urothelial cell nuclei. Sakaue et al. (2002) determined that Fgf10 is secreted by cultured mouse preadipocytes. Prevention of Fgf10 signaling inhibited the expression of C/EBP-beta (189965) and subsequent differentiation. In Fgf10-knockout mice, the expression of C/EBP-beta was reduced, and the ability of embryonic fibroblasts derived from Fgf10-knockout mice to differentiate into adipocytes was impaired. Using clustering of synaptic vesicles in cultured neurons as an assay, Umemori et al. (2004) purified putative target-derived presynaptic organizing molecules from mouse brain and identified Fgf22 (605831) as a major active species. Fgf7 and Fgf10, the closest relatives of Fgf22, shared this activity; other Fgfs had distinct effects. Neutralization of Fgf7, Fgf10, and Fgf22 inhibited presynaptic differentiation of mossy fibers at sites of contact with granule cells in vivo. Inactivation of Fgfr2 (176943) had similar effects. These results indicated that FGF22 and its relatives are presynaptic organizing molecules in the mammalian brain. MAPPING By radioactive in situ hybridization, Emoto et al. (1997) mapped the FGF10 gene to 5p13-p12. By FISH, Bagai et al. (2002) also mapped the FGF10 gene to chromosome 5p13-p12. MOLECULAR GENETICS Autosomal dominant aplasia of lacrimal and salivary glands (ALSG; 180920) is a rare condition characterized by irritable eyes and dryness of the mouth (xerostomia). In affected individuals, the misdiagnosis is often made of the more prevalent disorder Sjogren syndrome (270150), an autoimmune condition characterized by keratoconjunctivitis sicca and xerostomia. Entesarian et al. (2005) studied 2 extended Swedish families with ALSG in a total of 16 individuals. Thirteen of the individuals had absence of 1 or more lacrimal puncta. The segregation pattern suggested full penetrance. A genomewide screen showed linkage of ALSG to 5p13.2-q13.1. DNA sequence analysis identified a 53-kb deletion in the FGF10 gene (602115.0002), including exons 2 and 3, and without the involvement of any flanking genes, in affected members of 1 family and a heterozygous arg193-to-ter substitution (R193X; 602115.0001), resulting in a truncated protein, in each of the 4 affected members of the other family. Both mutations were consistent with the idea that haploinsufficiency for FGF10 underlies ALSG. To clarify whether FGF10 mutations cause dry eyes and dry mouth in sporadic cases with symptoms identical to those in individuals with ALSG, Entesarian et al. (2005) screened DNA samples from 74 individuals diagnosed with dry eyes and/or dry mouth but without fulfilling the criteria for Sjogren syndrome for mutations in FGF10. No sequence alterations in the coding region of FGF10 were found in samples from these individuals. Entesarian et al. (2005) concluded that mutations in FGF10 appeared to be uncommon in individuals with nonspecific sicca syndromes. ANIMAL MODEL On the basis of its spatiotemporal expression pattern in the developing embryo, the FGF10 gene is predicted to function as a regulator of brain, lung, and limb development. To define the role of the Fgf10 gene, Sekine et al. (1999) generated Fgf10-deficient mice. Homozygous-deficient mice died at birth due to the lack of lung development. Trachea was formed, but subsequent pulmonary branching morphology was disrupted. In addition, mutant mice had complete truncation of the fore- and hindlimbs. In the homozygous-deficient embryos, limb bud formation was initiated, but outgrowth of the limb buds did not occur; however, formation of the clavicles was not affected. Analysis of the expression of marker genes in the mutant limb buds indicated that the apical ectodermal ridge (AER) and the zone of polarizing activity (ZPA) did not form. Thus, Sekine et al. (1999) showed that Fgf10 serves as an essential regulator of lung and limb formation. Hogan (1999) reviewed the function of mouse Fgf10 in lung morphogenesis. Min et al. (1998) generated Fgf10-deficient mice by targeted disruption. Limb bud initiation was abolished in Fgf10 -/- mice. Strikingly, Fgf10 -/- fetuses continued to develop until birth, despite the complete absence of both fore- and hindlimbs. Fgf10 is necessary for AER formation and acts epistatically upstream of Fgf8 (600483), the earliest known AER marker in mice. Fgf10 -/- mice exhibited perinatal lethality associated with complete absence of lungs. Although tracheal development was normal, mainstem bronchial formation, as well as all subsequent pulmonary branching morphogenesis, was completely disrupted. The pulmonary phenotype of Fgf10 -/- mice is strikingly similar to that of the Drosophila mutant branchless (602465), an Fgf homolog. In Fgf10 -/- mice, Suzuki et al. (2000) detected abnormalities in epidermal morphogenesis including a decrease in proliferating cells, a hypoplastic granular layer, and a lack of distinctive keratohyaline granules and tonofibrils. There was also a reduction of loricrin (152445) expression in skin. Because Fgf10-deficient mice die soon after birth, Suzuki et al. (2000) transplanted fetal skin onto nude mice to demonstrate that hair development can occur normally in Fgf10-deficient skin. The authors concluded that Fgf10 is required for embryonic epidermal morphogenesis, but is not essential for hair follicle development. Kelly et al. (2001) analyzed a transgenic mouse line in which a LacZ reporter gene had integrated upstream of the Fgf10 gene. They detected transgene expression in the embryonic right ventricle and outflow tract of the heart and in contiguous splanchnic and pharyngeal mesoderm. After Dil labeling of cultured mouse embryos, they proposed that the embryonic heart is derived from 2 myocardial precursor cell populations: 1 which gives rise to the early heart tube and inflow region and 1, expressing Fgf10, in pharyngeal mesoderm which gives rise to the outflow tract and possibly also the embryonic right ventricle. Kelly et al. (2001) concluded that Fgf10-expressing cells in pharyngeal mesoderm give rise to the arterial pole of the mouse heart. In Fgf10 -/-, Fgf receptor-2b -/-, and Sonic hedgehog (SHH; 600725) -/- mice, which all exhibit cleft palate, Rice et al. (2004) showed that Shh is a downstream target of Fgf10/Fgfr2b signaling. Using BrdU staining, they demonstrated that mesenchymal Fgf10 regulates the epithelial expression of Shh, which in turn signals back to the mesenchyme. This was confirmed by the finding that cell proliferation was decreased not only in the palatal epithelium but also in the mesenchyme of Fgfr2b -/- mice. Rice et al. (2004) concluded that coordinated epithelial-mesenchymal interactions are essential during the initial stages of palate development and require an FGF-SHH signaling network. After finding mutations in the FGF10 gene in human cases of aplasia of lacrimal salivary glands, Entesarian et al. (2005) reexamined Fgf10 +/- mice. These mice were found also to have aplasia of lacrimal glands and hypoplasia of salivary glands. Other internal organs, including lung, liver, spleen, heart, stomach, thyroid, pancreas, intestines, and ovaries, were macroscopically normal.

comment: DESCRIPTION The SRY (480000) and SOX proteins share a DNA-binding domain known as the HMG box, defined by a 79-amino acid region. All SOX proteins have a single HMG box and bind linear DNA in a sequence-specific manner, resulting in the bending of DNA through large angles. Bending causes the DNA helix to open for some distance, which may affect binding and interactions of other transcription factors. SOX1, SOX2 (184429), and SOX3 (313430) show the closest homology to SRY. They share maximum homology within the HMG domain and are expressed mainly in the developing nervous system of the mouse (Collignon et al., 1996). These genes share significant homology outside the HMG box also and are highly conserved throughout their evolution. CLONING Malas et al. (1997) cloned the human SOX1 gene. MAPPING Malas et al. (1997) mapped the human SOX1 gene to 13q34 by fluorescence in situ hybridization. Located in the terminal band of 13q, SOX1 is proximal to transcription factor DP1 (189902). Malas et al. (1996) mapped the mouse Sox1 gene to proximal mouse chromosome 8. GENE FUNCTION In developing chick spinal cord, Bylund et al. (2003) found that Sox1, Sox2, and Sox3 were coexpressed in self-renewing progenitor cells and acted to inhibit neuronal differentiation. Active repression of the Sox genes promoted neural progenitor cells to initiate differentiation prematurely. Further studies showed that the ability of the proneural transcription factor neurogenin-2 (NEUROG2; 606624) to promote neuronal differentiation was based on its ability to suppress Sox gene expression, thus showing that neurogenesis is regulated by an interplay between proneural proteins and inhibitory proteins.

comment: In a 5-generation family with multiple musculoskeletal anomalies, Stalker and Zori (1997) described an apparently new malformation syndrome with autosomal dominant inheritance. The features included the Pierre Robin-type cleft palate, pectus excavatum, rib anomalies, and hypoplasia of the distal segments of the scapulae. The propositus at birth was mildly hypotonic with a Robin-type cleft involving the soft and hard palate with micrognathia, and with moderately severe pectus excavatum. Radiographs showed 11 pairs of ribs and hypoplasia of the inferior subscapular area, more pronounced on the left than on the right. The mother at birth had a U-shaped cleft of the soft palate and micrognathia, a grade II/VI systolic murmur that resolved neonatally, moderate pectus excavatum, low-set hairline, and hyperextensibility of joints. The maternal grandmother of the propositus had micrognathia with intact palate, webbed neck with low-set hairline, hypoplastic scapulae, severe pectus excavatum, and no joint hyperextensibility. Radiographs showed 11 pairs of ribs, hypoplasia of the subscapular areas, and a dysplastic right third rib. Among the other members of the family, there was one instance of male-to-male transmission. Stalker and Zori (1997) considered the syndrome in this family to be distinct from other reported syndromes, including the disorder reported by Chitayat et al. (1991) in 2 half brothers (see 311895). Stalker et al. (2001) subsequently reported that, after the birth of an infant with multiple congenital anomalies and an unbalanced karyotype of 46,XX, der(13)t(13;17)(q22.1;q23.3), the mother was identified as having a balanced 13/17 translocation, 46,XX, t(13;17)(q22.1;q23.3). The translocation segregated with the skeletal phenotype in all family members studied. The authors noted that chromosome analysis should be considered when a previously unrecognized collection of physical or developmental problems is segregating in a kindred. Hill-Harfe et al. (2005) mapped the chromosome 17 breakpoint in the family studied by Stalker and Zori (1997) and Stalker et al. (2001), which they called 'family F,' at a site 931.8 kb upstream of the transcriptional start of the SOX9 gene (608160). They concluded that the disorder in this family might be a mild form of campomelic dysplasia (114290). Pierre Robin sequence (261800), hypoplastic scapulae, and 11 pairs of ribs were the primary features in family F and are also nearly universal in both mild and severe forms of CMPD. Family F also had minor facial dysmorphism consisting of flat face, broad nasal bridge, micrognathia, and hypertelorism, consistent with CMPD. However, many of other features of CMPD were not present in this family: stature and life span were normal; there was no bowing of the long bones and no clubbing of the feet; pelvic bones, spine, and epiphyses were normal; there was no evidence of sex reversal. Hill-Harfe et al. (2005) noted that the scoliosis and hearing loss that are nearly ubiquitous in long-term survivors of CMPD (Mansour et al., 2002) were not seen in family F. Unger (2005) suggested that the disorder in the patients reported by Stalker and Zori (1997) was in fact the mildest end of the spectrum of campomelic dysplasia. In a reply to the letter of Unger (2005), Stalker et al. (2005) agreed that the abnormalities in their family might be caused by disruption of SOX9 expression, but argued that it was also possible that they were caused by disruption of an as yet unknown gene distinct from SOX9. Velagaleti et al. (2005) presented a balanced translocation, t(4;17) (q28.3;q24.3), segregating in a family with mild CMPD with Pierre Robin sequence. They found that the 17q24.3 breakpoint mapped approximately 900 kb upstream of SOX9, which was within the same BAC clone as the breakpoints of 2 other reported patients with mild CMPD. The authors identified a candidate upstream cis-regulatory element, SOX9cre1 (SOX9 conserved regulatory element-1). They suggested that the mild CMPD phenotype found in their patient and others (Stalker and Zori, 1997; Stalker et al., 2001; Hill-Harfe et al., 2005) may be the result of slightly modified expression of chondrocyte-specific genes, secondary to altered SOX9 regulation as a result of spatial dissociation from the distal SOX9cre1.

comment: CLONING The syndecans (e.g., SDC1; 186355) are transmembrane proteoglycans that place structurally heterogeneous heparan sulfate chains at the cell surface and a highly conserved polypeptide in the cytoplasm. Versatile heparan sulfate moieties support various processes of molecular recognition, signaling, and trafficking. Grootjans et al. (1997) reported the identification of a protein that binds to the cytoplasmic domains of the syndecans in yeast 2-hybrid screens and other assays. This protein, designated syntenin, contains a tandem repeat of PDZ domains that reacts with the FYA (phe-tyr-ala) C-terminal amino acid sequence of the syndecans. Proteins produced by fusion of green fluorescent protein and syntenin colocalized to plasma membranes and intracellular vesicles with syndecans. Cells that overexpress the fusion protein showed numerous cell surface extensions, suggesting effects of syntenin on cytoskeleton-membrane organization. Grootjans et al. (1997) proposed that syntenin may function as an adaptor that couples syndecans to cytoskeletal proteins or cytosolic downstream signal-effectors. Fernandez-Larrea et al. (1999) used the 2-hybrid screen to identify pro-TGF-alpha (190170) cytoplasmic domain-binding proteins, which they referred to as TACIPs (pro-TGF-alpha cytoplasmic domain-interacting proteins), involved in the trafficking of pro-TGF-alpha. They cloned 2 such proteins, TACIP1 and TACIP18, both of which showed a lack of interaction with a pro-TGF-alpha C-terminal mutant that does not reach the cell surface. TACIP1 and TACP18 are identical to the PDZ proteins alpha-1-syntrophin (601017) and syntenin, respectively. Fernandez-Larrea et al. (1999) noted that TACIP18/syntenin had also been identified as melanoma differentiation-associated gene-9, or MDA9, by Lin et al. (1998). GENE FUNCTION PDZ domains are known to bind to the C terminus of a variety of transmembrane proteins. Accordingly, Fernandez-Larrea et al. (1999) demonstrated that the PDZ domains of TACIP1 and TACIP18 are responsible for the interaction with the cytoplasmic domain of pro-TGF-alpha. Analysis of a panel of pro-TGF-alpha C-terminal mutants showed that mutations that prevented the binding to TACIP1, but not to TACIP18, did not disrupt the transport of pro-TGF-alpha to the cell surface in vivo. Furthermore, the cytoplasmic domain of syndecan-2 (142460), which is also known to bind TACIP18, efficiently replaces that of pro-TGF-alpha, since pro-TGF-alpha/syndecan chimeric molecules were transported to the cell surface with normal kinetics. Mutations that prevented the binding of TACIP18 to the cytoplasmic domain of syndecans also interfered with the normal trafficking of pro-TGF-alpha/syndecan chimeras, further supporting a role for TACIP18 in the trafficking of pro-TGF-alpha. Unlike the majority of PDZ proteins, which localize near the plasma membrane, TACIP18 localizes early in the secretory pathway. In vivo, TACIP18 specifically interacted with immature pro-TGF-alpha in a perinuclear area that colocalizes with endoplasmic reticulum markers. The interleukin-5 (IL5; 147850) receptor consists of the IL5-specific alpha subunit (IL5RA; 147851) and the signal-transducing beta-subunit, CFS2RB (138981), which is shared with IL3 (147740) and GMCSF (138960). Using a yeast 2-hybrid screen of a granulocyte cDNA library with the cytoplasmic domain of IL5RA as bait, Geijsen et al. (2001) identified an interaction of IL5RA with syntenin. GST pull-down, BIAcore, coimmunoprecipitation, and deletion mutant analyses confirmed an association of syntenin with the last 15 C-terminal residues of IL5RA; syntenin did not interact with CFS2RB. Within this 15-residue stretch of IL5RA, the C-terminal phenylalanine is critical. Deletion of either of the 2 tandem PDZ domains of syntenin, which are known to interact with C-terminal peptide sequences, abrogated the IL5RA-syntenin interaction. A second 2-hybrid screen identified the mouse transcriptional factor Sox4 (184430) as a binding partner for syntenin but not for IL5RA. The syntenin-Sox4 interaction occurs outside of the PDZ domains of syntenin. Luciferase reporter analysis and fluorescence microscopy showed that IL5, but not IL3, induces cytoplasmic and nuclear expression of syntenin and, in a syntenin- and cytoplasmic IL5RA-dependent manner, of Sox4. Geijsen et al. (2001) concluded that syntenin acts as an adaptor molecule in the IL5RA-mediated activation of SOX4. They also noted that mice lacking either Il5ra or Sox4 have defects in B-cell development. Zimmermann et al. (2002) showed that the PDZ domains of several proteins bind phosphatidylinositol 4,5-bisphosphate (PIP2). High-affinity binding of syntenin to PIP2-containing lipid layers required both of its PDZ domains. Competition and mutagenesis experiments revealed that the protein- and the PIP2-binding sites in the PDZ domains overlap. Overlay assays indicated that the 2 PDZ domains of syntenin cooperate in binding to cognate peptides and PIP2. Experiments on living cells demonstrated PIP2-dependent and peptide-dependent modes of plasma membrane association of the PDZ domains of syntenin. These observations suggested that local changes in phosphoinositide concentration control the association of PDZ proteins with their target receptors at the plasma membrane.

comment: DESCRIPTION The testis-determining gene SRY (480000) encodes a transcription factor characterized by a DNA-binding motif known as the HMG (high mobility group) domain. The SOX gene family consists of genes related to SRY, with a sequence identity of more than 60% to the SRY HMG box. CLONING Using a rat SOX10 cDNA probe to screen a human brain cDNA library, Pingault et al. (1998) isolated a human SOX10 cDNA predicted to encode a 466-amino acid protein with a highly conserved HMG domain. Pusch et al. (1998) cloned and sequenced the human SOX10 and the mouse Sox10 genes, which share 98% amino acid identity. Sequence analysis suggested that SOX9 (608160) and SOX10 have a common evolutionary origin. Northern blot analysis detected a 2.9-kb SOX10 mRNA in fetal brain and in adult heart, brain, small intestine, and colon. Low-level expression was seen in prostate and testis. In mouse embryos, Sox10 expression was detected in the developing peripheral nervous system, most prominent in the trigeminal, geniculate, and acoustic ganglia. Kuhlbrodt et al. (1998) cloned the rat SOX10 gene, which encodes a 466-amino acid protein with a molecular mass of approximately 50 kD. Northern blot analysis detected a 3-kb SOX10 mRNA transcript that was largely restricted to glial cells in the adult nervous system. During development, SOX10 first appeared in the forming neural crest and continued to be expressed as these cells contributed to the forming peripheral nervous system and finally differentiated into Schwann cells. In the central nervous system, SOX10 transcripts were originally confined to glial precursors and later detected in oligodendrocytes of the adult brain. GENE STRUCTURE Pingault et al. (1998) determined that the human SOX10 gene contains 5 exons. MAPPING Lane and Liu (1984) determined that a mouse model of Hirschsprung disease (HSCR; 142623), dominant megacolon (Dom), mapped to a mid-terminal region of mouse chromosome 15 (see ANIMAL MODEL). Pingault et al. (1997) noted that, in mice, natural and in vitro-induced mutations affecting the Ret (164761), Ednrb (131242), and Edn3 (131244) genes generated phenotypes similar to human Hirschsprung disease. Using polymorphisms for conserved human/mouse genes, Pingault et al. (1997) established homology between the Dom locus and human chromosome 22q12-q13. Two genes, Smstr3 and Adsl (608222), not previously mapped in the mouse genome, were also mapped to mouse chromosome 15. The investigators stated that 3 genes, Smstr3, Lgals1 (150570), and Pdgfb (190040), are possible Dom candidates, as they did not recombine with the Dom mutation in a backcross. GENE FUNCTION Kuhlbrodt et al. (1998) studied 4 SOX10 mutations found in patients with Waardenburg-Shah syndrome (WS4; 277580). Unlike the rat SOX10 protein, which failed to show transcriptional activity on its own, wildtype human SOX10 displayed a weak, but reproducible, activity as a transcriptional activator. All mutant SOX10 proteins, including the 1 that lacked only the last 106 amino acids, were deficient in this capacity, indicating that the C terminus of human SOX10 carries a transactivation domain. Whereas all 4 mutants failed to transactivate, only 2 failed to enhance synergistically the activity of other transcription factors. Synergy required the ability to bind to DNA and a region in the N-terminal part of SOX10. Those mutants that failed to synergize were unable to bind to DNA. Analysis of the naturally occurring SOX10 mutations not only helped to dissect SOX10 structure, but also allowed limited predictions on the severity of the disease. To evaluate further the role of Sox10 in development and disease, Southard-Smith et al. (1999) performed comparative genomic analyses. An essential role for the SOX10 gene in neural crest development was supported by zoo blot hybridizations that revealed extensive conservation throughout vertebrate evolution and by similar Northern blot expression profiles between mouse and man. Variability in the disease phenotype of patients with WS4 suggests the influence of genetic modifier loci in the disorder. Mice heterozygous for the Sox10(Dom) allele exhibit variability of aganglionosis and hypopigmentation influenced by genetic background similar to that observed in WS4 patients. Southard-Smith et al. (1999) constructed Sox10(Dom)/+ congenic lines to segregate loci that modify the neural crest defects in the heterozygous mice. Consistent with previous studies, increased lethality in the heterozygous mice resulted from a C57BL/6J locus; also, an increase in hypopigmentation was noted in conjunction with a locus in another strain. Linkage analysis localized a hypopigmentation modifier of the Dom phenotype to mouse chromosome 10 in close proximity to a modifier of hypopigmentation for the EDNRB (131244) mouse model of WS4. Potterf et al. (2000) elucidated the hierarchical relationship of 3 transcription factors, MITF (156845), PAX3 (606597), and SOX10, that are capable of producing several different forms of Waardenburg syndrome, WS2A (193510), WS1 (193500), and WS4 (277580), respectively. SOX10 was able to transactivate the MITF promoter 100-fold, and the transactivation was further stimulated by PAX3. By promoter deletion and mutation analyses, Potterf et al. (2000) showed that SOX10 can activate MITF expression through binding to a region that is evolutionarily conserved between the mouse and human MITF promoters. A SOX10 mutant that models C-terminal truncations in patients with WS can reduce wildtype SOX10 induction of MITF, suggesting that these mutations may act in a dominant-negative fashion. The data support a model in which the hypopigmentation of WS results from a disruption in function of the central melanocyte transcription factor MITF. Bondurand et al. (2000) also showed that SOX10, in synergy with PAX3, strongly activates MITF expression in transfection assays. Transfection experiments revealed that PAX3 and SOX10 interact directly by binding to a proximal region of the MITF promoter containing binding sites for both factors. Mutant SOX10 or PAX3 proteins failed to transactivate this promoter, providing further evidence that the 2 genes act in concert to directly regulate expression of MITF. In situ hybridization experiments carried out in the dominant megacolon (Dom) mouse confirmed that SOX10 dysfunction impaired Mitf expression as well as melanocytic development and survival. The authors hypothesized that interaction between 3 of the genes that are altered in WS could explain the auditory/pigmentary symptoms of this disease. Lee et al. (2000) demonstrated that wildtype SOX10 directly binds and activates transcription of the MITF promoter, whereas a mutant form of the SOX10 protein (602229.0001) associated with Waardenburg-Shah syndrome acts as a dominant-negative repressor of MITF expression and reduces endogenous MITF protein levels. The ability of SOX10 to activate transcription of the MITF promoter implicates SOX10 in the regulation of melanocyte development and provides a molecular basis for the hypopigmentation and deafness associated with WS4. Connexin-32 (CX32, GJB1; 304040) is a major protein of peripheral myelin. Mutations in CX32 have been characterized in patients with the X-linked form of Charcot-Marie-Tooth disease (CMTX1; 302800), a peripheral neuropathy. Bondurand et al. (2001) showed that SOX10, in synergy with EGR2 (129010), strongly activates CX32 expression in vitro by directly binding to its promoter. In agreement with this finding, SOX10 and EGR2 mutants identified in patients with peripheral myelin defects failed to transactivate the CX32 promoter. In addition, some CMTX1 patients harbored a T-to-G transversion at position -528 of the CX32 promoter (304040.0015). The authors demonstrated that this mutation eliminates binding and activation by SOX10. SOX10 acts as a critical transactivator of tyrosinase-related protein-1 (TYRP1; 115501) during melanoblast development and as a potent transactivator of MITF, which is considered to be a master gene that controls the development and postnatal survival of melanocytes. Khong and Rosenberg (2002) identified, for the first time, the presence of de novo cellular immune reactivity against SOX10, using tumor-infiltrating lymphocytes obtained from a 63-year-old woman with metastases of melanoma refractory to chemotherapy, who was started on a 4-peptide vaccination protocol. Most of her tumors completely regressed after 2 cycles of immunotherapy, including complete resolution of a large tumor in her left thigh, an intrapelvic mass, a liver lesion, and most of the nodules in her lungs. She also developed vitiligo on the dorsal areas of her hand and distal forearm bilaterally. The Sox10 and Pax3 transcription factors can directly regulate both MITF and RET (164761) in a synergistic fashion. Lang and Epstein (2003) showed that Pax3 and Sox10 can physically interact; this interaction contributes to synergistic activation of a conserved RET enhancer, and it explains why Sox10 mutants that cannot bind DNA still retain the ability to activate this enhancer in the presence of Pax3. However, in the context of the MITF gene, Pax3 and Sox10 must each bind independently to DNA in order to achieve synergy. These observations appear to explain the phenotype in the mild form of Yemenite deaf-blind syndrome (601706) caused by a specific SOX10 mutation (602229.0005) in the HMG box that abrogates DNA binding without disrupting association with PAX3. Using gene expression profiling, Iwashita et al. (2003) determined that genes associated with Hirschsprung disease were highly upregulated in rat gut neural crest stem cells relative to whole-fetus RNA. The genes with highest expression were GDNF (600837), SOX10, GFRA1 (601496), and EDNRB. The highest expression was seen in RET (164761), which was found to be necessary for neural crest stem cell migration in the gut. GDNF promoted the migration of neural crest stem cells in culture but did not affect their survival or proliferation. The observations made by Iwashita et al. (2003) were confirmed by quantitative RT-PCR, flow cytometry, and functional analysis. By expression of Sox9 or Sox10 in early Xenopus embryos, Taylor and LaBonne (2005) found that each factor could direct the formation of neural crest precursors and the development of a range of neural crest derivatives. They detected no differences in the activities of Sox9 and Sox10 in these assays. They identified Sumo1 (601912) and Ubc9 (UBE2I; 601661) as Sox-interacting proteins that play a role in regulating the function of Sox9 and Sox10 during neural crest and inner ear development. MOLECULAR GENETICS Based on the finding that Sox10 underlies the Dom mouse model (see ANIMAL MODEL), Southard-Smith et al. (1998) and Herbarth et al. (1998) considered SOX10 to be a likely candidate for the site of mutations in individuals with HSCR or WS whose disease had not been related to mutations in other genes. In Waardenburg-Shah syndrome, patients have deafness, pigmentary abnormalities, and Hirschsprung disease, all caused by defects in the embryonic neural crest. In 4 patients with Waardenburg-Shah syndrome, Pingault et al. (1998) identified mutations in the SOX10 gene (602229.0001-602229.0004). Each mutation was predicted to result in loss of function, suggesting that the pathologic mechanism is haploinsufficiency. In 2 patients with WS4, Southard-Smith et al. (1999) identified mutations in the SOX10 gene (602229.0009-602229.0010). Of 12 unrelated Waardenburg-Shah syndrome patients recruited by the Genetic Center at the Necker Hospital in Paris, Touraine et al. (2000) described 3 patients with growth retardation and a previously unreported neurologic phenotype with impairment of both the central and autonomic nervous systems and occasionally neonatal hypotonia and arthrogryposis (609136). Each of the 3 patients was heterozygous for a SOX10 truncating mutation: tyr313 to ter (Y313X; 602229.0006) or ser251 to ter (S251X; 602229.0007). The extended spectrum of the WS4 phenotype was considered relevant to the brain expression of SOX10 during human embryonic and fetal development. The expression of SOX10 in human embryo was not restricted to the neural crest-derived cells but also involved fetal brain cells, most likely of glial origin. The data emphasized the important role of SOX10 in early development of both neural crest-derived tissues, namely melanocytes and autonomic and enteric nervous systems, and glial cells of the central nervous system. Pingault et al. (2000) described a patient with peripheral neuropathy with hypomyelination who had deafness and chronic intestinal pseudoobstruction, but not Hirschsprung disease or pigmentary abnormalities. Chronic intestinal pseudoobstruction is defined by repetitive episodes or continuous symptoms of bowel obstruction, in the absence of a mechanical occluding lesion. It differs from Hirschsprung disease by the persistence of ganglionic cells and nervous plexus in the submucosal compartments of the bowel. Neuropathic, myopathic, and unclassified forms have been distinguished on the basis of histopathologic criteria; autosomal dominant (155310), autosomal recessive (243180, 603041), and X-linked (300048) inheritance have been observed. To refine the nosology of WS4, Pingault et al. (2002) studied patients with typical WS4, including Hirschsprung disease, or with WS and intestinal pseudoobstruction. In patients presenting with the classic form of WS4, they identified 3 SOX10 mutations, 1 EDNRB mutation, and 1 EDN3 mutation; in patients displaying WS features and chronic intestinal pseudoobstruction, they identified 2 SOX10 mutations. The results showed that chronic intestinal pseudoobstruction may be a manifestation associated with WS, and indicated that aganglionosis is not the only mechanism underlying the intestinal dysfunction of patients with SOX10 mutations. In an infant with pigmentary abnormalities, deafness, and decreased myenteric and submucosal ganglion cells in the colon and small bowel, Inoue et al. (2002) identified a truncating mutation in the SOX10 gene (602229.0011). In 4 patients with the neurologic variant of Waardenburg-Shah syndrome, which is also called PCWH (peripheral demyelinating neuropathy, central demyelinating leukodystrophy, Waardenburg syndrome, and Hirschsprung disease), Inoue et al. (2004) identified truncating mutations in the SOX10 gene; 2 patients, including 1 who had previously been reported by Jacobs and Wilson (1992), had the Y313X mutation (602229.0006). All the mutations were located in the last exon (exon 5) in the 3-prime region of the SOX10 gene. Functional analysis showed that the truncating mutations suppressed the transcriptional activity of cotransfected wildtype SOX10 in a dose-dependent manner, suggesting that PCWH is caused by dominant-negative mutations. However, 2 truncating mutations (602229.0001 and 602229.0009) associated with the less severe WS4 phenotype showed the same effects. Northern blot analysis demonstrated that WS4-associated mutations, but not PCWH-associated mutations, lead to a reduction in mRNA via the nonsense-mediated decay (NMD) pathway, thereby preventing a dominant-negative effect. Inoue et al. (2004) noted that the results were consistent with the NMD RNA surveillance pathway, which typically degrades only transcripts containing nonsense mutations that are followed by at least 1 intron (Carter et al., 1996; Nagy and Maquat, 1998), as usually occurs with WS4-associated mutations. Accordingly, the PCWH-associated mutations that occur in the last SOX10 exon, and are not followed by an intron, may escape NMD and express large amounts of dominant-negative protein. Similar results were obtained for truncating mutations in the myelin protein zero gene (MPZ; 159440) that cause distinct myelinopathies. Inoue et al. (2004) suggested that, in general, the NMD mechanism may function protectively to convert dominant-negative effects to haploinsufficiency. ANIMAL MODEL A mouse model of Hirschsprung disease (HSCR; 142623), dominant megacolon (Dom), arose spontaneously at the Jackson Laboratory (Lane and Liu, 1984). Megacolon was associated with dominantly inherited spotting. Dom/+ heterozygous mice displayed regional deficiencies of neural crest-derived enteric ganglia in the distal colon, whereas Dom/Dom homozygous animals were embryonic lethal. The Dom locus mapped to a mid-terminal region of mouse chromosome 15. Using a positional cloning strategy, Southard-Smith et al. (1998) identified Sox10 as the gene underlying the Dom Hirschsprung mouse model. BLAST analysis of the EST database identified the candidate transcript as Sox10 on the basis of its homology with the 163-bp sequence of the SRY-like HMG box transcription factor Sox10 (Stock et al., 1996; Wright et al., 1993). The finding was consistent with Sox10 expression in the 2 principal cell types affected in Dom/+ mice, neural crest-derived melanocytes and enteric ganglia. In Dom mice, Southard-Smith et al. (1998) identified a premature termination mutation of Sox10 underlying the absence of neural crest derivatives. They demonstrated Sox10 expression in normal neural crest cells, disrupted expression of both Sox10 and the HSCR disease gene Ednrb in Dom mutant embryos, and loss of neural crest derivatives due to apoptosis. The authors concluded that Sox10 is essential for proper peripheral nervous system development. Herbarth et al. (1998) also showed that the Dom mutant mouse is caused by a defect in the Sox10 gene and that Sox10 is an essential factor in mouse neural crest development. Paratore et al. (2002) used mice with a targeted deletion of the Sox10 gene to study the etiology of Hirschsprung disease. Neural crest-derived enteric progenitors that were heterozygous for the Sox10 mutation colonized the proximal intestine but were unaffected in their survival capacity. However, unlike their wildtype counterparts, mutant enteric neural crest-derived cells were unable to maintain their progenitor state and acquired preneuronal traits, which resulted in a reduction of the progenitor pool size. Thus, the cells that normally colonize the hindgut were depleted in the Sox10 mutant, causing the distal bowel to become aganglionic.

comment: A number sign (#) is used with this entry because desmosterolosis has been found to be caused by mutation in the DHCR24 gene (606418). DESCRIPTION Desmosterolosis is a rare autosomal recessive disorder characterized by multiple congenital anomalies and elevated levels of the cholesterol precursor desmosterol in plasma, tissue, and cultured cells. CLINICAL FEATURES FitzPatrick et al. (1998) reported the case of an infant with multiple lethal congenital malformations and osteosclerosis in whom there was generalized accumulation of an abnormal neutral sterol and a relative deficiency of cholesterol. The sterol was identified by gas chromatography-mass spectrometry (GC-MS) as desmosterol, a biosynthetic precursor of cholesterol. The infant had macrocephaly, hypoplastic nasal bridge, thick alveolar ridges, gingival nodules, cleft palate, total anomalous pulmonary venous drainage, ambiguous genitalia, short limbs, and generalized osteosclerosis. FitzPatrick et al. (1998) compared the phenotype to that of Smith-Lemli-Opitz syndrome (270400), which is a defect in the synthesis of cholesterol, and Raine syndrome (259775), which is characterized by generalized osteosclerosis, nasal hypoplasia, and gingival nodules. The abnormal accumulations of desmosterol occurred in the kidney, liver, and brain. Higher than normal levels of the same sterol were detected in plasma samples obtained from both parents. The biochemical phenotype was highly suggestive of a novel inborn error of cholesterol biosynthesis caused by an autosomal recessive deficiency of 3-beta-hydroxysterol-delta-24-reductase. Because of the phenotypic overlap with Raine syndrome, postmortem tissue samples from the patient with Raine syndrome described by Kan and Kozlowski (1992) were analyzed; however, desmosterol accumulation was not found in the tissues of that case, suggesting that it represented a distinct disorder. FitzPatrick et al. (1998) stated that there are 2 general mechanisms by which aberrant cholesterol synthesis may cause malformations: a relative deficiency of cholesterol and a relative excess of sterol precursor. These are not mutually exclusive. Furthermore, the hedgehog family of proteins, mutations in which have been identified in malformations (e.g., SHH; 600725), have been shown to undergo posttranslational modification by covalent attachment of a cholesterol molecule to the biologically active N-terminal fragment of these peptides (Porter et al., 1996). MOLECULAR GENETICS In 2 patients with desmosterolosis described by FitzPatrick et al. (1998) and Andersson et al. (2000, 2002), Waterham et al. (2001) identified mutations in the DHCR24 gene (606418.0001-606418.0003). Andersson et al. (2000, 2002) described a boy with desmosterolosis who was born at term with microcephaly, agenesis of the corpus callosum, downslanting palpebral fissures, bilateral epicanthal folds, submucous cleft palate, micrognathia, mild contractures of the hands, bilateral clubfeet, cutis aplasia, and persistent patent ductus arteriosus. At 40 months of age, he was severely developmentally delayed but was learning to walk, used 5 words, and followed simple commands. Height and weight were less than the 2nd centile. Radiologic examination disclosed neither rhizomelic shortness nor osteosclerosis. Plasma sterol quantification when the patient was 2 years old demonstrated a normal cholesterol level but a 100-fold increase in desmosterol. Both parents had mildly increased levels of desmosterol in plasma, consistent with heterozygosity for DHCR24 deficiency. Analysis of sterol metabolism in cultured transformed lymphoblasts showed a 100-fold increased level of desmosterol and a moderately decreased level of cholesterol in the patient's cells and a 10-fold elevation of desmosterol in the mother's cells. DNA analysis of the patient and his parents identified a homozygous and heterozygous mutation, respectively, in the DHCR24 gene that when expressed in yeast had a residual activity of 20%.

comment: A number sign (#) is used with this entry because of evidence that some cases of the branchiootic syndrome are due to mutations in the EYA1 gene (601653) which is also the site of mutations causing branchiootorenal dysplasia (BOR; 113650). CLINICAL FEATURES The branchiootorenal syndrome comprises preauricular pits, branchial fistulas, hearing impairment, and renal anomalies. It is inherited as an autosomal dominant. In some families, the phenotypic expression is limited to branchial anomalies, preauricular pits, and hearing loss, with no renal dysplasia; this has been referred to as the branchiootic or BO syndrome. Melnick et al. (1978) maintained that the BOR syndrome is distinct from branchiootic syndrome because in the latter condition renal anomaly is absent and deafness is not a constant feature. Cremers and Fikkers-van Noord (1980) concluded, however, that the BOR syndrome and the BO syndrome are one entity. See also 113600 and 113650. MAPPING Vincent et al. (1997) analyzed 2 large independent families in which each of the 8 affected members presented exclusively with BO syndrome. In both families, linkage analysis mapped the causative gene to the same chromosomal region on 8q13.3 as EYA1 (601653). MOLECULAR GENETICS Vincent et al. (1997) demonstrated a 2-bp insertion in the EYA1 gene (601653.0003) in 1 of 2 families with BO syndrome. In the other family, they detected an 8-bp deletion (601653.0004). HETEROGENEITY Kumar et al. (1998) performed linkage studies in a large family with BO syndrome and failed to find linkage to the 8q13 region, where the BOR syndrome was known to map. Thus the BOR and BO syndromes (at least the BO syndrome in the large family studied) appeared to be nonallelic. Stratakis et al. (1998) reported another example of presumed branchiootic syndrome with no linkage to 8q13.3. In a family with affected members in 4 successive generations in an autosomal dominant pedigree pattern, 15 affected members were studied. Ear pits were present in all of them, whereas hearing loss and other branchial arch anomalies were present in 40% and 20%, respectively. None of the affected members had renal abnormalities or lacrimal duct stenosis. - BOS2 The form of branchiootic syndrome designated BOS2 (120502) maps to chromosome 1 (Kumar et al., 2000). - BOS3 Ruf et al. (2003) mapped a third locus for branchiootic syndrome (BOS3; 608389) to 14q21.3-q24.3.

comment: CLONING Retinoic acid receptors (see 180220) and retinoid X receptors (see 180245) bind to specific cis-acting retinoid-responsive promoter elements in response to retinoids. By screening a human embryonic liver cDNA expression library to identify factors that specifically interact with the retinoid X receptor responsive element (RXRE) from the rat cellular retinol-binding protein II (RBP2; 180280) promoter, Bertolino et al. (1995) recovered cDNAs encoding TGIF. Northern blot analysis revealed that TGIF is expressed as a 2-kb transcript in various tissues. The predicted 272-amino acid TGIF protein belongs to the TALE ('three amino acid loop extension') family of homeodomain-containing proteins. GENE FUNCTION Bertolino et al. (1995) found that TGIF can prevent the retinoid X receptor from functioning as a transcriptional activator by interfering with the Rbp2-RXRE. The canonical TGIF binding site contains a TGTCA core sequence located 5-prime to directly repeated AGGTCA half-sites that are recognized by zinc finger-containing nuclear receptors. This binding site is conserved in several RBP2-RXRE-like responsive elements. The TGIF gene is expressed during early brain development in mice (Bertolino et al., 1996). Wotton et al. (1999) identified the homeodomain protein TGIF as a SMAD2 (MADH2; 601366)-binding protein and a repressor of transcription. A transforming growth factor-beta (TGFB; see 190180)-activated SMAD complex can recruit TGIF and histone deacetylases (HDACs; see 601241) to a SMAD target promoter, repressing transcription. Thus, upon entering the nucleus, a SMAD2/SMAD4 (MADH4; 600993) complex may interact with coactivators, forming a transcriptional activation complex, or with TGIF and HDACs, forming a transcriptional repressor complex. Formation of 1 of these 2 mutually exclusive complexes is determined by the relative levels of SMAD corepressors and coactivators within the cell. TGIF codes for a transcription factor that competitively inhibits binding of the retinoic acid receptor to a retinoid-responsive promoter. Therefore, decreased TGIF levels may lead to enhanced binding of retinoic acid receptor, indicating increased retinoic acid levels. Prenatal exposure to retinoic acid is associated with holoprosencephaly (HPE; see 236100)-like malformations in animal models (Sulik et al., 1995). In addition, high doses of retinoic acid downregulate Sonic hedgehog (SHH; 600725) expression in craniofacial primordia in the chicken. Thus, decreased TGIF could result in decreased SHH expression, which could accentuate the effects of an allele of the SHH gene with reduced or no activity. Nanni et al. (1999) reported that only 10% of patients carrying a TGIF deletion show HPE. Thus, it is possible that either maternal retinoic acid levels or altered activity in another protein could modify the effects of TGIF. MOLECULAR GENETICS Gripp et al. (1998) identified 4 missense mutations in the TGIF gene in patients with holoprosencephaly-4 (142946); see 602630.0001-602630.0004. In 2 families with holoprosencephaly, Nanni et al. (1999) identified mutations in the TGIF gene in association with mutations in the SHH gene; the form of holoprosencephaly due to mutation in the SHH gene is referred to as holoprosencephaly-3 (HPE3; 142945). They proposed that the intrafamilial variability in holoprosencephaly may be due to the collaboration of 2 or more unlinked genes, such as SHH and TGIF. Aguilella et al. (2003) sequenced the TGIF gene of 127 HPE probands. In 2 families presenting a wide range of disease severity, they identified a novel gln107-to-leu mutation (Q107L; 602630.0006) and what they stated was the first nonsense mutation identified in the TGIF gene, tyr59 to ter (Y59X; 602630.0005). Lam et al. (2003) investigated the coding exons of TGIF for mutations in Chinese patients with high myopia. Six SNPs showed a significant difference (P less than 0.05) between patient and control subjects in univariate analysis. Only 657T-G showed statistical significance in the logistic regression model (odds ratio 0.133; 95% CI 0.036-0.488; P = 0.002). Thus, TGIF is a probable candidate gene for high myopia. ANIMAL MODEL In animal models, genes in the Nodal signaling pathway, such as those in the zebrafish mutants 'cyclops,' 'squint,' and 'one-eyed pinhead,' cause HPE. Mice heterozygous for null alleles of both Nodal (601265) and Smad2 have cyclopia. By FISH analysis, Gripp et al. (2000) demonstrated that the TGIF gene resides within the HPE4 minimal critical region. They found that the TGIF gene contains 4 exons, the last 3 of which contain coding information. Mutation analysis of the TGIF gene in 268 DNA samples of patients with HPE detected 4 heterozygous missense mutations in the coding region, 1 of which was identified in familial HPE and 3 of which were identified in clinically sporadic cases. These mutations affected the transcriptional repression domain of TGIF, the DNA-binding domain, or the domain that interacts with SMAD2, an effector in the NODAL signaling pathway. Several of the mutations caused a loss of TGIF function. Gripp et al. (2000) concluded that TGIF links the NODAL signaling pathway to the bifurcation of the human forebrain and the establishment of ventral midline structures.

comment: 'Polycomb' genes in Drosophila maintain the repressed state of homeotic and other developmentally regulated genes (Wedeen et al., 1986; Kuziora and McGinnis, 1988) by mediating changes in higher-order chromatin structure (Paro and Hogness, 1991). M33, a mouse homolog of polycomb, was isolated by means of the structural similarity of its chromodomain (Pearce et al., 1992). The fifth exon of M33 contains a region of homology shared by Drosophila and Xenopus. In Drosophila, its deletion results in the loss of polycomb function. Katoh-Fukui et al. (1998) disrupted M33 in mice by inserting a poly(A) targeting vector into its fifth exon. More than half of the resultant homozygous mutant mice died before weaning, and survivors showed male-to-female sex reversal. Formation of genital ridges was retarded in both XX and XY homozygous mutant embryos. Gonadal growth defects appeared near the time of expression of the Y-chromosome-specific Sry gene (480000), suggesting that M33 deficiency may cause sex reversal by interfering with steps upstream of Sry. Katoh-Fukui et al. (1998) pointed out that point mutations in the human SOX9 gene (608160) cause campomelic dysplasia (CMPD1; 114290) associated with male sex reversal. Because M33 is located distal to Sox9 on mouse chromosome 11 with a linkage of 5.3 cM, the possibility that Sox9 was affected coincidentally during gene targeting in ES cells was considered. However, this possibility was ruled out by other transgenic experiments. Katoh-Fukui et al. (1998) suggested that these homozygous M33-mutant mice represent the first case in which male-to-female gonadal sex reversal results from a defect in a known recessive gene. The human homolog of polycomb in Drosophila and M33 in mouse is presumably located on 17q since human SOX9 maps to 17q24.3-q25.1. Gecz et al. (1995) isolated genomic clones of the human M33 homolog, which they designated CBX2. By analysis of somatic cell hybrids and by fluorescence in situ hybridization, Gecz et al. (1995) mapped the CBX2 gene to 17q25.

comment: CLONING Using Xenopus noggin cDNA, Valenzuela et al. (1995) cloned full-length human genomic and cDNA NOG clones from a placenta genomic and a temporal cortex cDNA library. They also cloned a partial rat NOG cDNA from a brain cDNA library. Human NOG encodes a deduced 232-amino acid protein that shares 81% sequence identity with the Xenopus protein. In protein activity assays, human NOG appeared to share the inductive actions of Xenopus noggin during early embryogenesis. Northern blot analysis of adult rat tissues revealed predominant expression in most parts of the central nervous system, with especially high expression in mitral and tufted cells in the olfactory bulb, and in Purkinje cells in the cerebellum. Low or undetectable levels were found in peripheral nerve and nonneural tissues; in the latter tissues, detectable levels were found in lung, skeletal muscle, and skin. GENE FUNCTION The bones of the developing limb bud are formed by condensations of chondrocytes followed by endochondral ossification. Postembryonic growth continues at the growth plates, at the ends of the bones. A series of inductive events determines the size and shape of individual limb skeletal elements. Many growth factors of the bone morphogenetic protein (BMP) family have been implicated in limb growth and patterning. The joints are formed after the initial cartilage condensation and are first recognized histologically by an increase in cell density. Cell death and cavitation follows. Growth/differentiation factor-5 (GDF5; 601146), a divergent member of the BMP family, is implicated in joint specification through its expression in prospective joints and its disruption in the 'brachypodism' mouse mutation. GDF5, also known as cartilage-derived morphogenetic protein-1, is mutant in several chondrodysplasias, such as the Grebe type of chondrodysplasia (200700) and the Hunter-Thompson type of acromesomelic dysplasia (201250), as well as in type C brachydactyly (113100). Brunet et al. (1998) showed that expression of the mouse noggin gene is essential for proper skeletal development. BMP activities are modulated not only through gene expression and protein processing, but also by interaction with antagonists such as noggin and chordin (603475). Excess BMP activity in noggin-null mice results in excess cartilage and failure to initiate joint formation. Murine noggin is expressed in condensing cartilage and immature chondrocytes, as are many BMPs. The excess BMP activity in the absence of noggin antagonism may enhance the recruitment of cells into cartilage, resulting in oversized growth plates. Chondrocytes are also refractory to joint-inducing positional cues. The noggin gene was first discovered as an important factor in brain and nerve development. Knockout mice have stubby, continuous limbs with lack of joints in the paws, along with a fatal array of other developmental defects. The gene earned its name when, in connection with studies of its role in the brain and nervous system, it was found that frog embryos injected with its mRNA grew exceptionally large heads. In the developing frog, the noggin protein also mimics the activity of the Spemann organizer, which can make dorsal tissue out of ventral tissue. In a series of expression studies in mouse, Tucker et al. (1998) demonstrated that BMP4 activates the expression of Msx1 (142983), leading to incisor tooth development. BMP4 inhibited expression of Barx1 (603260), which marks presumptive molar teeth, and limits expression to the proximal, presumptive molar mesenchyme at embryonic day 10. Fibroblast growth factor-8 (FGF8; 600483) stimulated Barx1 expression. When BMP4 signaling in early development was inhibited by application of exogenous noggin protein, ectopic Barx1 expression resulted in transformation of tooth identity from incisor to molar. Gazzerro et al. (1998) examined the expression of noggin and chordin in cultures of osteoblast-enriched cells from 22-day-old fetal rat calvaria. BMP2 (112261) caused a time- and dose-dependent increase in noggin mRNA and polypeptide levels. The effects of BMP2 on noggin transcripts were dependent on protein synthesis, but independent of DNA synthesis. BMP2 increased the rates of noggin transcription. BMP4, BMP6 (112266), and TGF-beta-1 (190180) increased noggin mRNA in rat calvaria cells, but basic fibroblast growth factor-2 (FGF2; 134920), platelet-derived growth factor-beta (PDGFB; 190040), and insulin-like growth factor-1 (IGF1; 147440) did not. Noggin decreased the stimulatory effects of BMPs on DNA and collagen synthesis as well as alkaline phosphatase activity in rat calvaria cells. The authors concluded that BMPs induced noggin transcription in osteoblast cells, a probable mechanism to limit BMP action in osteoblasts. The morphogenesis of organs as diverse as lungs, teeth, and hair follicles is initiated by a downgrowth from a layer of epithelial stem cells. During follicular morphogenesis, stem cells form this bud structure by changing their polarity and cell-cell contact. Jamora et al. (2003) showed that this process is achieved through simultaneous receipt of 2 external signals: a WNT protein (WNT3A; 606359) to stabilize beta-catenin (116806), and a bone morphogenetic protein inhibitor (noggin) to produce Lef1 (153245). Beta-catenin binds to and activates Lef1 transcription complexes that appear to act uncharacteristically by downregulating the gene encoding E-cadherin (192090), an important component of polarity and intercellular adhesion. When either signal is missing, functional Lef1 complexes are not made, and E-cadherin downregulation and follicle morphogenesis are impaired. In Drosophila, E-cadherin can influence the plane of cell division and cytoskeletal dynamics. Consistent with this notion, Jamora et al. (2003) showed that forced elevation of E-cadherin levels block invagination and follicle production. Jamora et al. (2003) concluded that their findings reveal an intricate molecular program that links 2 extracellular signaling pathways to the formation of a nuclear transcription factor that acts on target genes to remodel cellular junctions and permit follicle formation. Warren et al. (2003) demonstrated that noggin is expressed postnatally in the suture mesenchyme of patent, but not of fusing, cranial sutures, and that noggin expression is suppressed by FGF2 (134920) and syndromic FGFR signaling. Warren et al. (2003) studied the effects of Apert (S252W; 176943.0010) and Crouzon (see C342Y; 176943.0001) syndrome Fgfr2 gain-of-function mutations on noggin production in dural cell and osteoblast cultures. Both Apert and Crouzon syndrome Fgfr2 mutants markedly downregulated noggin protein production in sagittal dura mater. The Apert and Crouzon Fgfr2 constructs also downregulated Bmp4 (112262)-induced noggin expression in calvarial osteoblasts. Because both Apert and Crouzon syndrome Fgfr gain-of-function mutations promote pathologic suture fusion, Warren et al. (2003) concluded that their findings provide an important link between the murine models and the gain-of-function Fgfr mutations associated with syndromic Fgfr-mediated craniosynostoses. Warren et al. (2003) also showed that forced expression of noggin maintained posterior frontal suture patency in mice. They suggested that since ectopic noggin expression prevented the fusion of mouse posterior frontal sutures, it is possible that therapeutic noggin could be exploited to control postnatal skeletal development. Winkler et al. (2004) found that human sclerostin (SOST; 605740) interacted directly with noggin in vitro. The sclerostin-noggin interaction neutralized the ability of either protein to bind and inhibit BMP6, permitting BMP6 mitogenic activity in a mouse osteosarcoma cell line. Immunoprecipitation of sclerostin from a rat osteosarcoma cell line indicated that endogenous rat sclerostin forms a complex with Bmp2, Bmp5 (112265), and noggin. BIOCHEMICAL FEATURES - Crystal Structure Groppe et al. (2002) reported the crystal structure of the antagonist noggin bound to BMP7 (112267), which showed that noggin inhibits BMP signaling by blocking the molecular interfaces of the binding epitopes for both type I and type II receptors. The BMP binding affinity of site-specific variants of noggin was correlated with alterations in bone formation and apoptosis in chick limb development, showing that noggin functions by sequestering its ligand in an inactive complex. The scaffold of noggin contains a cystine (the oxidized form of cysteine) knot topology similar to that of BMPs. Thus, Groppe et al. (2002) concluded that ligand and antagonist seem to have evolved from a common ancestral gene. MAPPING Using fluorescence in situ hybridization, Valenzuela et al. (1995) showed that the human NOG gene maps to 17q22. Both proximal symphalangism (SYM1; 185800) and the multiple synostoses syndrome (SYNS1; 186500) were known to map to the same region. Gong et al. (1999) performed radiation hybrid mapping, placing NOG between genetic markers D17S790 and D17S794. Thus, NOG was a prime candidate gene for SYM1 and SYNS1 and prompted a mutation search. MOLECULAR GENETICS Gong et al. (1999) identified 5 dominant human NOG mutations in unrelated families with SYM1 and a de novo mutation in a patient with unaffected parents. They also found a dominant NOG mutation in a family segregating SYNS1; both SYM1 and SYNS1 have multiple joint fusion as their principal feature. All 7 NOG mutations altered evolutionarily conserved amino acid residues. The findings confirmed that NOG is essential for joint formation and suggested that NOG requirements during skeletogenesis differ between species and between specific skeletal elements within species. Differences between humans and mice with respect to phenotypes caused by heterozygous mutations had been observed previously with GDF5 (601146), which encodes a member of the TGF-beta superfamily. This prompted Gong et al. (1999) to determine whether similar differences result from heterozygous mutations in the TGF-beta family member antagonist NOG. Marcelino et al. (2001) investigated the effect on the structure and function of noggin of the W217G mutation (602991.0003), which causes SYNS, and the P223L mutation (602991.0004) and the G189C (602991.0005) mutation, each of which causes SYM1. The SYNS1 mutation abolished, and the SYM1 mutations reduced, the secretion of functional noggin dimers in transiently transfected COS-7 cells. Coexpression of mutant noggin with wildtype noggin, to resemble the heterozygous state, did not interfere with wildtype noggin secretion. These data indicated that the human disease-causing mutations are hypomorphic alleles that reduce secretion of functional dimeric noggin. The authors concluded that noggin has both species-specific and joint-specific dosage-dependent roles during joint formation. Lucotte et al. (1999) reported that a patient with fibrodysplasia ossificans progressiva (FOP; 135100) had a 42-bp heterozygous deletion in the NOG gene. To determine if NOG mutations are a general finding in FOP, Xu et al. (2000) examined 31 families with 1 or more FOP patients, including the patient reported by Lucotte et al. (1999). No mutations were found. Xu et al. (2000) noted that the protein-coding region of this single-exon gene is extremely GC-rich (67%) which suggests that the gene may be highly methylated and/or susceptible to secondary structure formation, conditions that interfere with the fidelity of PCR amplification and could plausibly explain the previously reported and subsequently unverifiable NOG deletion in the patient with FOP. In 4 Spanish patients with FOP, Semonin et al. (2001) reported heterozygosity for 3 different mutations in the NOG gene. Xu et al. (2002) stated that these reported mutations in the NOG gene are PCR errors as described in their previous study (Xu et al., 2000). Warman (2002) suggested that the divergent results might arise from methodologic issues including possible phenotype error and/or the use of a nested PCR approach which increases the likelihood of PCR-induced artifacts; he proposed that photographs and radiographs of the patients with FOP and NOG mutations be published and that DNA samples from patients with putative disease-causing FOP mutations be shared with other laboratories for independent confirmation using a different methodology. Dixon et al. (2001) identified 3 different missense mutations in NOG that resulted in tarsal-carpal coalition syndrome (186570). Two of these mutations are identical to mutations previously reported to cause proximal symphalangism. Brown et al. (2002) identified truncating mutation in the NOG gene in 2 families with autosomal dominant stapes ankylosis with broad thumbs and toes, hyperopia, and skeletal anomalies (184460) but without symphalangism. The first family, of Italian descent, had conductive hearing loss that was inherited as an autosomal dominant with complete penetrance. Each affected individual was thought to have had nonsyndromic otosclerosis but was found on further study to have a congenital stapes ankylosis syndrome that included hyperopia, a hemicylindrical nose, broad thumbs and big toes, and other minor skeletal anomalies. The second family was that reported by Milunsky et al. (1999). ANIMAL MODEL The secreted polypeptide noggin (encoded by the Nog gene) binds and inactivates members of the transforming growth factor-beta superfamily signaling proteins, such as bone morphogenetic protein-4 (BMP4; 112262). By diffusing through extracellular matrices more efficiently than members of the TGF-beta superfamily, noggin may have a principal role in creating morphogenic gradients. During mouse embryogenesis, Nog is expressed at multiple sites, including developing bones. Nog -/- mice die at birth from multiple defects that include bony fusion of the appendicular skeleton (McMahon et al., 1998; Brunet et al., 1998). Bachiller et al. (2000) demonstrated that at midgastrula, expression of noggin overlaps that of chordin. Noggin mutants underwent normal gastrulation and anterior central nervous system patterning, although at later stages a number of abnormalities were observed in posterior spinal cord and somites. Bachiller et al. (2000) set up intercrosses between mice compound heterozygous for noggin and chordin mutations, but no double-homozygous mutants were recovered among the neonates. Two chordin/noggin double-null embryos were found among animals dissected close to term. Both were undergoing resorption, but clearly had holoprosencephaly, with a single nasal pit, a cyclopic eye, and agnathia. These malformations, not observed in either mutant on its own, represented the weakest phenotypes found in double-mutant mice and resembled embryos lacking sonic hedgehog (SHH; 600725). At embryonic day 12.5, double-mutant embryos were recovered with more severe phenotypes resembling aprosencephaly. In double-mutant embryos dissected at embryonic day 8.5, forebrain reduction was clearly evident. Bachiller et al. (2000) concluded that chordin and noggin are not necessary for establishing the anterior visceral endoderm but are required for subsequent elaboration of anterior pattern. Mesodermal development was also affected, indicated by the lack of shh. Bachiller et al. (2000) suggested that the BMP antagonists chordin and noggin compensate for each other during early mouse development. When both gene products are removed, antero-posterior, dorso-ventral, and left-right patterning are all affected. Using adult Nog +/- mice with a LacZ transgene inserted at the site of the Nog deletion, Wu et al. (2003) demonstrated Nog expression in osteoblast and chondrocyte cell lines as well as bone marrow macrophages. They found that despite identical BMP levels, osteoblasts of 20-month-old C57BL/6J and 4-month-old sensescence-accelerated (SAM-P6) mice had noggin expression levels that were approximately 4-fold higher than those of 4-month-old C57BL/6J and SAM-R1 (control) mice, respectively. Transgenic mice overexpressing noggin in mature osteocalcin-positive osteoblasts showed dramatic decreases in bone mineral density and bone formation rates. These results suggested that NOG, expressed in mature osteoblasts, inhibits osteoblast differentiation and bone formation. Wu et al. (2003) concluded that overproduction of NOG during biologic aging may result in impaired osteoblast formation and function and thus net bone loss.

comment: Cohen et al. (1979) described a family in which a 3;8 chromosomal translocation, t(3;8)(p14.2;q24.1), was associated with classic features of hereditary renal cell carcinoma (144700), i.e., autosomal dominant inheritance, early onset, and bilateral disease. Follow-up analysis found the occurrence of thyroid cancer in 2 translocation carriers with RCC (Li et al., 1993). Although studies demonstrated that the 3p14.2 breakpoint interrupted the fragile histidine triad gene (FHIT; 601153) in its 5-prime noncoding region (Ohta et al., 1996), several reasons made it unlikely that FHIT is causally related to renal or other malignancies. Gemmill et al. (1998) showed that the 8q24.1 breakpoint region encodes a 664-amino acid multiple membrane-spanning protein, which they called TRC8, for 'translocation in renal carcinoma, chromosome 8 gene.' The gene showed similarity to the hereditary basal cell carcinoma/segment polarity gene, 'patched.' This similarity involved 2 regions of 'patched,' the putative sterol-sensing domain and the second extracellular loop that participates in the binding of sonic hedgehog (SHH; 600725). In the 3;8 translocation, TRC8 was found to be fused to FHIT and disrupted within the sterol-sensing domain. In contrast, the FHIT coding region was maintained and expressed. In a series of sporadic renal carcinomas, an acquired TRC8 mutation was identified. By analogy to patched, TRC8 might function as a signaling receptor, and other pathway members, to be defined, are mutation candidates in malignant diseases involving the kidney and thyroid. Gemmill et al. (2002) isolated the Drosophila homolog of TRC8 and studied its function by genetic manipulations and a yeast 2-hybrid screen. Human and Drosophila TRC8 proteins localize to the endoplasmic reticulum. Loss of either Drosophila Trc8 or Vhl resulted in an identical ventral midline defect. Direct interaction between Trc8 and Vhl in drosophila was confirmed by GST-pull-down and coimmunoprecipitation experiments. Gemmill et al. (2002) found that in Drosophila, overexpression of Trc8 inhibited growth consistent with its presumed role as a tumor suppressor gene. Human JAB1 (604850) localization was dependent on VHL mutant status. Thus, the VHL, TRC8, and JAB1 proteins appear to be linked both physically and functionally, and all 3 may participate in the development of kidney cancer. Melendez et al. (2003) described a family in which a t(3;8)(p13;q24.1) translocation was present in 2 consecutive generations and 2 members of the family, the proband and his mother, had clear cell renal carcinoma. The translocation-carrier status of the mother could be deduced because there were other relatives with the translocation in her family. In the proband, Melendez et al. (2003) observed loss of the derivative chromosome, der(8), carrying the 3p segment, and somatic mutation of the VHL gene (608537) in tumor tissue from the left kidney; the tumor in the right kidney carried a different VHL mutation and loss of heterozygosity (LOH) was not detected. Tumor tissue in the mother did not carry any VHL gene mutations.

comment: CLONING Using a Xenopus expression-cloning screen, Hsu et al. (1998) isolated Gremlin, an antagonist of bone morphogenetic protein (BMP) signaling that is expressed in the neural crest. Gremlin belongs to a novel gene family that includes the head-inducing factor Cerberus (603777) and the tumor suppressor DAN (600613). Hsu et al. (1998) showed that all family members are secreted proteins and that they act as BMP antagonists in embryonic explants. They also provided support for the model that Gremlin, Cerberus, and DAN block BMP signaling by binding BMPs, preventing them from interacting with their receptors. They proposed that Gremlin, Cerberus, and DAN control diverse processes in growth and development by selectively antagonizing the activities of different subsets of the transforming growth factor (TGF)-beta ligands. By homology searches, Hsu et al. (1998) cloned the human homolog of Xenopus Gremlin. The human gremlin cDNA encodes a predicted 184-amino acid protein. MAPPING By somatic cell hybrid and radiation hybrid analyses, Topol et al. (2000) mapped the CKTSF1B1 gene to human chromosome 15q13-q15. GENE FUNCTION Zuniga et al. (1999) reported that the secreted BMP antagonist Gremlin relays the sonic hedgehog (SHH; 600725) signal from the polarizing region to the apical ectodermal ridge. Mesenchymal Gremlin expression is lost in limb buds of mouse embryos homozygous for the 'limb deformity' (ld) mutation, which disrupts establishment of the Shh/Fgf4 (164980) feedback loop. Grafting Gremlin-expressing cells into ld mutant limb buds rescued Fgf4 expression and restored the Shh/Fgf4 feedback loop. Analysis of Shh-null mutant embryos revealed that Shh signaling is required for maintenance of Gremlin and Formin (136535), the gene disrupted by the ld mutations. In contrast, Formin, Gremlin, and Fgf4 activation were independent of Shh signaling. Zuniga et al. (1999) concluded that the study uncovered the cascade by which the SHH signal is relayed from the posterior mesenchyme to the apical ectodermal ridge and established that Formin-dependent activation of the BMP antagonist Gremlin is sufficient to induce Fgf4 and establish the SHH/Fgf4 feedback loop. Vertebrate limb outgrowth is driven by a positive feedback loop involving SHH, Gremlin, and FGF4. By overexpressing individual components of the loop at a time after these genes are normally downregulated in chicken embryos, Scherz et al. (2004) found that Shh no longer maintains Gremlin in the posterior limb. Shh-expressing cells and their descendants cannot express Gremlin. The proliferation of these descendants forms a barrier separating the Shh signal from Gremlin-expressing cells, which breaks down the Shh-Fgf4 loop and thereby affects limb size and provides a mechanism explaining regulative properties of the limb bud. ANIMAL MODEL During limb outgrowth, signaling by BMPs must be moderated to maintain the signaling loop between the zone of polarizing activity (ZPA) and the apical ectodermal ridge (AER). Gremlin, an extracellular BMP antagonist, has been proposed to fulfill this function and therefore be important in limb patterning. Khokha et al. (2003) tested this model directly by mutating the mouse gene encoding Gremlin. In the mutant limb, the feedback loop between the ZPA and the AER was interrupted, resulting in abnormal skeletal pattern. The phenotype is apparently identical to that of ld, which results from a mutation in the Formin gene (Fmn). The relationship between Gremlin and Fmn is interesting because of their proximity in the mouse genome. The Fmn transcript comprises a large number of exons with the most 3-prime exon located approximately 40 kb from the Gremlin open reading frame. Given the apparently identical phenotype of ld mice to Gremlin mutant mice and the proximity of Fmn to Gremlin, Khokha et al. (2003) tested whether Gremlin would complement ld. They found that Gremlin fails to complement ld and thus identified another ld allele. Although a complex interaction between Fmn and Gremlin is possible, Khokha et al. (2003) favored the idea that the ld mutations affect Gremlin expression directly and that they lie in cis-regulatory elements for Gremlin expression.

comment: CLONING Holoprosencephaly is the most common structural anomaly of the human brain and is one of the anomalies seen in patients with deletions and duplications of chromosome 13. Brown et al. (1998) reported that the human ZIC2 gene, a homolog of the Drosophila 'odd-paired' (opa) gene, maps to the region of chromosome 13 associated with holoprosencephaly (HPE5; 609637). The human ZIC2 gene was identified by defining a region of conserved synteny with the mouse genome, using several anonymous cDNA clones that had previously been assigned to chromosome 13q32. One mouse clone was shown to be a portion of Zic2 as reported by Aruga et al. (1996). Mouse Zic2 was identified through homology to the Drosophila opa gene, and previous studies had shown that Zic2 expression during mouse embryonic development is consistent with a major role in brain and distal limb development (Nagai et al., 1997). In humans, Northern blot analysis showed expression of ZIC2 in fetal brain only. GENE FUNCTION Using a yeast 1-hybrid screen with the proximal region of the APOE (107741) promoter as bait, Salero et al. (2001) isolated cDNAs encoding the ZIC1 (600470) and ZIC2 transcription factors. Electrophoretic mobility shift and mutational analyses identified binding sites in the -136 to -125, -65 to -54, and -185 to -174 regions of the APOE promoter. Luciferase reporter analysis showed that the ZIC proteins stimulate potent transcriptional activation of APOE through these binding sites. Herrera et al. (2003) found that mouse Zic2 was expressed in retinal ganglion cells (RGCs) with an uncrossed trajectory during the period when this subpopulation grew from the ventrotemporal retina toward the optic chiasm. Loss- and gain-of-function analyses indicated that Zic2 was necessary and sufficient to regulate RGC axon repulsion by cues at the optic chiasm midline. Moreover, expression of Zic2 correlated with the extent of binocularity in pigmented mouse, albino mouse, ferret, frog, and chicken. Herrera et al. (2003) concluded that ZIC2 is an evolutionarily conserved determinant of RGCs that project ipsilaterally. MAPPING The ZIC2 gene maps to chromosome 13q32 (Brown et al., 1998). MOLECULAR GENETICS Brown et al. (1998) determined that heterozygous mutations in ZIC2 are associated with HPE5 (609637). Haploinsufficiency of ZIC2 is likely to cause the brain malformation seen in 13q deletion patients. Brown et al. (1998) used SSCP to screen for ZIC2 mutations in DNA samples from 150 patients with sporadic HPE and 63 patients with familial HPE. One sporadic patient showed a 56-bp head-to-tail repeat insertion in the first exon of the gene (603073.0001). In a second sporadic case, a 1-bp C insertion caused a frameshift that altered the last 90 amino acids, or approximately 20%, of the protein (603073.0002). In a third family with 2 sibs affected with HPE, Brown et al. (1998) determined that both had a 30-bp insertion in the third exon of ZIC2 (603073.0003). This insertion was a head-to-tail repeat and expanded the alanine tract normally present at that position from 15 to 25 alanine residues. In a fourth family with a single child affected with HPE, Brown et al. (1998) found a 7-bp deletion in the zinc finger region that destroyed the reading frame (603073.0004). Since mutations in both ZIC2 and SHH (600725) can cause HPE, Brown et al. (1998) raised the question of whether they act in the same or different developmental pathways. They noted that ZIC2 expression differs from that of SHH in that ZIC2 message is seen in the dorsal neural tube and SHH functions in the ventral neural tube, suggesting that these 2 proteins may affect neural development in different ways. None of the patients with ZIC2 mutations had serious malformations of the face; facial malformation is a frequent occurrence with SHH mutations. Brown et al. (2001) found 15 ZIC2 mutations within a cohort of 509 isolated holoprosencephaly cases. Seven mutations were frameshifts that were predicted to result in loss of function, further supporting the idea that ZIC2 haploinsufficiency can result in HPE. One mutation, an alanine tract expansion which is caused by the expansion of an imperfect trinucleotide repeat, occurred in 7 patients from 6 different families. In 3 of those families, the father was found to be apparently mosaic for the mutation. The authors hypothesized that this mutation may arise through errors in somatic recombination, an extremely unusual mutation mechanism.

comment: CLONING Nagayama et al. (1989) isolated a TSHR cDNA from a human thyroid cDNA library. The deduced 764-amino acid protein has a molecular mass of 86.8 kD and contains a signal peptide, 7 transmembrane regions, 5 potential glycosylation sites, and a short intracytoplasmic region. The TSHR cDNA encoded a functional receptor that activated adenylate cyclase in response to TSH. Libert et al. (1989) used a dog Tshr cDNA to isolate a human TSHR cDNA from a thyroid cDNA library. The cDNA encodes a deduced 744-amino acid protein with 90.3% homology to the dog protein. Two major 4.6- and 4.4-kb mRNA transcripts were identified, suggesting alternative splicing. By analyzing several TSHR cDNA clones, Misrahi et al. (1990) determined that the mature TSHR polypeptide contains 743 amino acids with a calculated molecular mass of 84.5 kD. The putative TSH receptor has a 394-residue extracellular domain, a 266-residue transmembrane domain, and an 83-residue intracellular domain. The authors observed a high degree of homology with the luteinizing hormone/choriogonadotropin receptor (LHCGR; 152790). Kakinuma and Nagayama (2002) found that the TSHR gene can express at least 5 alternatively spliced forms. GENE STRUCTURE Kakinuma and Nagayama (2002) determined that the TSHR gene contains 13 exons. MAPPING Akamizu et al. (1990) mapped the TSHR gene to human chromosome 14 by study of somatic cell hybrid DNAs. By in situ hybridization, Rousseau-Merck et al. (1990) and Libert et al. (1990) regionalized the gene to 14q31. Akamizu et al. (1990) mapped the mouse Tshr gene to chromosome 12 using linkage studies in interspecies backcross mice. Wilkie et al. (1993) also localized the mouse Tshr gene to chromosome 12. GENE FUNCTION The TSH receptor differs from the LHCG receptor by the presence of 2 unique insertions of 8 and 50 amino acids in the extracellular domain. Wadsworth et al. (1990) showed that the 8-amino acid tract near the amino terminus of the TSH receptor is an important site of interaction with both TSH and autoantibodies against the TSH receptor (thyroid-stimulating immunoglobulins, TSI). Either deletion or substitution of this region abolished the interaction, whereas a deletion of the 50-amino acid tract had no effect. Contiguous to the 5-prime end of the thyroid transcription factor-1 (TTF1; 600635) element upstream and within the TSHR promoter is an element on the noncoding strand with single-strand binding activity that is important for regulation of TSHR expression. Ohmori et al. (1996) identified a cDNA encoding a single-strand binding protein (SSBP), referred to as SSBP1, that forms a specific complex with this element on the noncoding strand of TSHR. SSBP1 is a ubiquitous transcription factor that contributes to TSHR maximal expression, and mutation analyses showed that a GXXXXG motif is important for the binding and enhancer function of SSBP1. The authors concluded that the common transcription factors regulate TSHR and major histocompatibility gene expression. They also concluded that SSBP1 is a member of a family of SSBPs that interact with RNA and with the promoter of retroviruses, and are important in RNA processing. Members of this family also can interact with c-myc (190080), a gene linked to growth and DNA replication. BIOCHEMICAL FEATURES The high sequence homology with the LHCG receptor, which is composed of a single polypeptide chain, led many to suppose a similar structure for the TSH receptor. However, Loosfelt et al. (1992) presented evidence for a heterodimeric structure of TSHR. The extracellular (hormone-binding) alpha subunit had an apparent molecular mass of 53 kD, whereas the membrane-spanning beta subunit seemed heterogeneous and had an apparent molecular mass of 33 to 42 kD. Human thyroid membranes contained 2.5 to 3 times as many beta subunits as alpha subunits; however, the 2 subunits probably derive from a single gene since a single reading frame was demonstrated by cDNA cloning and sequencing. The exact site of cleavage that results in the 2 subunits was difficult to define. The TSH receptor is the antigen targeted by autoantibodies in Graves disease (275000). By PCR amplification of specific cDNA, Feliciello et al. (1993) demonstrated that mature TSH receptor mRNA is expressed in the retroorbital tissue of both healthy subjects and patients with Graves disease. Of other tissues and cells tested, only thyroid tissue expressed the TSHR mRNA. The findings provided a link between orbital involvement and thyroid disease in Graves disease. Graves et al. (1999) used epitope-mapped monoclonal and polyclonal antibodies to TSHR as immunoblot probes to detect and characterize the molecular species of the receptor present in normal human thyroid tissue. In reduced membrane fractions, both full-length (uncleaved) holoreceptor and cleavage-derived subunits of the holoreceptor were detected. Uncleaved holoreceptor species included a nonglycosylated form of apparent molecular mass 85 kD and 2 glycosylated forms of approximately 110 and 120 kD. The membranes also contained several forms of cleavage-derived TSHR alpha and beta subunits. Alpha subunits were detected by antibodies to epitopes localized within the N-terminal end of the TSHR ectodomain and migrated diffusely between 45 and 55 kD, reflecting a differentially glycosylated status. Several species of beta subunit were present, the most abundant having apparent molecular masses of 50, 40, and 30 kD. The authors concluded that posttranslational processing of the TSHR occurs in human thyroid tissue and involves multiple cleavage sites. Lazar et al. (1999) studied the expression of 4 thyroid-specific genes (sodium-iodide symporter (NIS, or SLC5A5; 601843), thyroid peroxidase (TPO; 274500), thyroglobulin (TG; 188450), and TSHR) as well as the gene encoding glucose transporter-1 (GLUT1, or SLC2A1; 138140) in 90 human thyroid tissues. Messenger RNAs were extracted from 43 thyroid carcinomas (38 papillary and 5 follicular), 24 cold adenomas, 5 Graves thyroid tissues, 8 toxic adenomas, and 5 hyperplastic thyroid tissues; 5 normal thyroid tissues were used as reference. A kinetic quantitative PCR method, based on the fluorescent TaqMan methodology and real-time measurement of fluorescence, was used. NIS expression was decreased in 40 of 43 (93%) thyroid carcinomas and in 20 of 24 (83%) cold adenomas; it was increased in toxic adenomas and Graves thyroid tissues. TPO expression was decreased in thyroid carcinomas but was normal in cold adenomas; it was increased in toxic adenomas and Graves thyroid tissues. TG expression was decreased in thyroid carcinomas but was normal in the other tissues. TSHR expression was normal in most tissues studied and was decreased in only some thyroid carcinomas. In thyroid cancer tissues, a positive relationship was found between the individual levels of expression of NIS, TPO, TG, and TSHR. No relationship was found with the age of the patient. Higher tumor stages (stages greater than I vs stage I) were associated with lower expression of NIS and TPO. Expression of the GLUT1 gene was increased in 1 of 24 (4%) adenomas and in 8 of 43 (19%) thyroid carcinomas. In 6 thyroid carcinoma patients, 131-I uptake was studied in vivo. NIS expression was low in all samples, and 3 patients with normal GLUT1 expression had 131-I uptake in metastases, whereas the other 3 patients with increased GLUT1 gene expression had no detectable 131-I uptake. The authors concluded that (1) reduced NIS gene expression occurs in most hypofunctioning benign and malignant thyroid tumors; (2) there is differential regulation of the expression of thyroid-specific genes; and (3) an increased expression of GLUT1 in some malignant tumors may suggest a role for glucose-derivative tracers to detect in vivo thyroid cancer metastases by positron-emission tomography scanning. MOLECULAR GENETICS Vassart et al. (1991) reviewed the molecular genetics of the thyrotropin receptor. Trulzsch et al. (1999) described a database of TSHR mutations. The desirability of such a database came from the growing number of mutations identified and the variety of clinical phenotypes associated with the different mutations: somatic constitutively activating mutations in toxic thyroid nodules (e.g., 603372.0002); constitutively activating germline mutations as the cause of sporadic (e.g., 603372.0004) and familial (e.g., 603372.0019) nonautoimmune autosomal dominant hyperthyroidism (609152); and inactivating mutations associated with inherited TSH resistance (275200) (e.g., 603372.0005). Although Heldin et al. (1991) and Bahn et al. (1994) suggested that substitutions in the TSHR gene (D36H; 603372.0001 and pro52-to-thr; P52T) were associated with Graves disease (275000) and Graves ophthalmopathy, respectively, Simanainen et al. (1999) reported that the D36H and P52T substitutions were polymorphic variants with a frequency of approximately 5% and 7.3%, respectively. Simanainen et al. (1999) found no association between these 2 polymorphisms and Graves disease. Similarly, Kotsa et al. (1997) found no association between the TSHR P52T polymorphism and Graves disease among 180 patients with Graves disease. The variant allele was present in 8.3% of patients and 7.3% of controls. Dechairo et al. (2005) identified linkage disequilibrium blocks encompassing the TSHR gene and SNPs that captured the majority of intra-block haplotype diversity, then genotyped 1,059 Caucasian patients with autoimmune thyroid disease and 971 Caucasian controls for these and other common SNPs. The authors identified a haplotype across 2 linkage disequilibrium blocks that was significantly associated with Graves disease. Dechairo et al. (2005) replicated these findings by genotyping the SNP with the strongest association with Graves disease, dbSNP rs2268458, in a separate Caucasian group of 1,366 patients with autoimmune thyroid disease and 1,061 controls, and they suggested that TSHR is a Graves disease-specific locus. - Hyperfunctioning Thyroid Adenoma and Toxic Multinodular Goiter In 3 of 11 hyperfunctioning thyroid adenomas, Parma et al. (1993) identified somatic mutations in the TSHR gene (603372.0002; 603372.0003). These mutations were restricted to tumor tissue. By direct sequencing, Fuhrer et al. (1997) screened a consecutive series of 31 toxic thyroid nodules (TTNs) for mutations in exons 9 and 10 of the TSHR gene and in exons 7 to 10 of the Gs-alpha protein gene (GNAS1; 139320). Somatic TSHR mutations were identified in 15 of the 31 (48%) TTNs. The TSHR mutations were localized in the third intracellular loop (asp619-to-gly (603372.0002), ala623-to-val, and a 27-bp deletion resulting in deletion of 9 amino acids at codons 613 to 621), the sixth transmembrane segment (phe631to-leu (603372.0004), thr632-to-ile, and asp633-to-glu), the second extracellular loop (ile568-to-thr), and the third extracellular loop (val656-to-phe). One mutation, ser281-to-asn, was found in the part of the extracellular domain encoded by exon 9. All of the identified TSHR mutations resulted in constitutive activity. No mutations were found in exons 7 to 10 of GNAS1. The authors concluded that constitutively activating TSHR mutations occur in 48% of TTNs, representing the most frequent molecular mechanism known to cause TTNs. Parma et al. (1997) investigated 33 different, autonomous hot nodules from 31 patients for the presence of somatic mutations in the TSHR and Gs-alpha genes. Twenty-seven mutations (82%) were found in the TSHR gene, affecting a total of 12 different residues or locations. All but 2 of the mutations studied had previously been identified as activating mutations. The authors identified the 2 novel mutations as a point mutation causing a leu629-to-phe substitution (L629F; 603372.0022), a deletion of 12 bases removing residues 658-661 (asn-ser-lys-ile) at the C-terminal portion of exoloop 3 (del658-661). Only 2 mutations (6%) were found in Gs-alpha genes. In 4 nodules, no mutation was detected. Five residues (ser281, ile486, ile568, phe631, and asp633) were found to be mutated in 3 or 4 different nodules, making them hotspots for activating mutations. The authors concluded that in a cohort of patients from a moderately iodine-deficient area, somatic mutations increasing the constitutive activity of TSHR are the major cause of autonomous thyroid adenomas. Toxic multinodular goiter (TMNG) represents a frequent cause of endogenous hyperthyroidism, affecting 5 to 15% of such patients. To search for alterations of TSHR in autonomously functioning thyroid nodules (AFTN) and TMNG, Gabriel et al. (1999) used bidirectional, dye primer automated fluorescent DNA sequencing of the entire transmembrane domain and cytoplasmic tail of TSHR using DNA extracted from nodular regions of 24 patients with TMNG and 7 patients with AFTN. Eight of the 24 (33.3%) patients with TMNG were heterozygous for an asp727-to-glu polymorphism (D727E) in the cytoplasmic tail of TSHR. Three of the 24 (12.5%) patients with TMNG were heterozygous for a missense mutation, and 1 patient had multiple heterozygous mutations. Two patients had silent polymorphism of codons 460 and 618. The authors found no mutations in the transmembrane domain and cytoplasmic tail of TSHR in the 7 patients with AFTN, except for a silent polymorphism of codon 460 in 1. DNA fingerprinting of codon 727 using restriction enzyme NlaIII and genomic DNA confirmed the sequencing results in all cases, indicating that the sequence alterations were not somatic in nature. This technique was also used to examine peripheral blood genomic DNA from 52 normal individuals and 49 patients with Graves disease; 33.3% of TMNG (P of 0.019 vs normal subjects), 16.3% of Graves disease patients (P of 0.10 vs normal subjects), and 9.6% of normal individuals were heterozygous for the D727E polymorphism. Expression of the D727E variant in eukaryotic cells resulted in an exaggerated cAMP response to TSH stimulation compared with that of the wildtype TSHR. The authors concluded that the germline polymorphism D727E is associated with TMNG, and suggested that its presence is an important predisposing genetic factor in TMNG pathogenesis. Muhlberg et al. (2000) compared the D727E frequencies of 128 European Caucasian patients with toxic nonautoimmune thyroid disease (83 with toxic adenoma, 31 with toxic multinodular goiter, and 14 with disseminated autonomy) with those of 99 healthy controls and 108 patients with Graves disease. They found no significant differences in codon 727 polymorphism frequencies between patients with autonomously functioning thyroid disorders (13.3%) and the healthy control group (16.2%). Moreover, the subtypes of toxic nonautoimmune thyroid disease were not related to significant differences in codon 727 polymorphism frequencies compared with the healthy control group. There was no significant difference between the polymorphism frequency among patients with Graves disease (21.3%) and that of healthy controls. The authors concluded that there was no association between the D727E polymorphism of the TSHR and toxic thyroid adenomas or toxic multinodular goiter in their study population. Tonacchera et al. (2000) searched for inactivating TSHR or Gs-alpha mutations in areas of toxic or functionally autonomous multinodular goiters that appeared hyperfunctioning at thyroid scintiscan but did not clearly correspond to definite nodules at physical or ultrasonographic examination. Activating TSHR mutations were detected in 14 of these 20 hyperfunctioning areas, whereas no mutation was identified in nonfunctioning nodules or areas contained in the same gland. No Gs-alpha mutation was found. The authors concluded that activating TSHR mutations are present in the majority of nonadenomatous hyperfunctioning nodules scattered throughout the gland in patients with toxic or functionally autonomous multinodular goiter. - Nonautoimmune Hyperthyroidism Duprez et al. (1994) demonstrated heterozygous constitutively activating germline mutations in the TSHR gene (603372.0019; 603372.0020) in patients with hereditary nonautoimmune hyperthyroidism (609152). The functional in vitro characteristics of these 2 mutations were similar to those already described previously for autonomously functioning thyroid adenomas (Van Sande et al., 1995), and thus explained the development of thyroid hyperplasia and hyperthyroidism in the affected patients. Paschke and Ludgate (1997) found reports of 4 infants with sporadic congenital hyperthyroidism occurring from a de novo germline mutation. In all cases, both parents were euthyroid. The authors noted that a number of gain-of-function mutations had been observed as somatic mutations in hyperfunctioning thyroid adenomas and in familial autosomal dominant hyperthyroidism. In their Figure 1, Paschke and Ludgate (1997) outlined the constitutively activating and inactivating mutations of the TSHR gene, as well as the location of somatic mutations found in thyroid carcinomas. At some locations, several different amino acid substitutions had been described. Most gain-of-function mutations were in exon 10. - Nonautoimmune Congenital Thyrotropin Resistance Alberti et al. (2002) sequenced the entire TSHR gene in a series of 10 unrelated patients with slight (6.6-14.9 mU/liter) to moderate (24-46 mU/liter) elevations of serum TSH, associated with normal free thyroid hormone concentrations, consistent with a diagnosis of thyrotropin resistance (275200). Thyroid volume was normal in all patients, except 2 with modest hypoplasia. Autoimmune thyroid disease was excluded in all patients on the basis of clinical and biochemical parameters. Eight patients had at least 1 first-degree relative bearing the same biochemical picture. TSHR mutations were detected in 4 of 10 (40%) cases by analyzing DNA from peripheral leukocytes (see, e.g., 603372.0006; 603372.0029; 603372.0030; 603372.0031; 603372.0013). The authors concluded that partial resistance to TSH action is a frequent finding among patients with slight hyperthyrotropinemia of nonautoimmune origin, and that heterozygous germline mutations of TSHR may be associated with serum TSH values fluctuating above the upper limit of the normal range. - Familial Gestational Hyperthyroidism Rodien et al. (1998) described a gain-of-function mutation of the TSHR gene (603372.0024) as the cause of familial gestational hyperthyroidism (603373). The mutation rendered the thyrotropin receptor hypersensitive to chorionic gonadotropin. ANIMAL MODEL Using an adenovirus-mediated mouse model of Graves disease, Chen et al. (2003) demonstrated that goiter and hyperthyroidism occurred to a significantly greater extent when the adenovirus expressed the free alpha subunit as opposed to a genetically modified TSHR that cleaves minimally into subunits (p less than 0.005). Chen et al. (2003) concluded that shed alpha subunits induce or amplify the immune response leading to hyperthyroidism in Graves disease.

comment: DESCRIPTION Chordin is a key developmental protein that dorsalizes early vertebrate embryonic tissues by binding to ventralizing TGF-beta (e.g., 190180)-like bone morphogenetic proteins and sequestering them in latent complexes. CLONING Pappano et al. (1998) searched the sequence databases for mammalian chordin sequences and identified ESTs encoding the C-terminal regions of human CHRD and mouse Chrd. They determined the full-length cDNA sequence for mouse Chrd, which predicts a 948-amino acid protein containing 4 internal cysteine-rich repeats and 4 potential N-glycosylation sites. Northern blot analysis detected high levels of a 3.7-kb Chrd transcript in 7-day postcoitum mouse embryos; its level decreased at later developmental stages and in adult tissues. Dot blot analysis of mRNA expression in human adult and fetal tissues showed that CHRD is expressed at the highest level in liver. Smith et al. (1999) cloned and sequenced a human CHRD cDNA, which encodes a 954-amino acid protein that has 86% sequence identity with the mouse protein. GENE FUNCTION Chordin dorsalizes early vertebrate embryonic tissues by binding to bone morphogenetic proteins and sequestering them in latent complexes. Scott et al. (1999) showed that BMP1 (112264) and TLL1 (606742) counteracted the dorsalizing effects of chordin upon overexpression in Xenopus embryos. They suggested that BMP1 is the major chordin antagonist in early mammalian embryogenesis and in pre- and postnatal skeletogenesis. GENE STRUCTURE Smith et al. (1999) determined that the CHRD gene has 23 exons spanning 11.5 kb. MAPPING Pappano et al. (1998) localized the human CHRD gene to 3q27 by radiation hybrid mapping and the mouse Chrd gene to proximal chromosome 16 using interspecific backcrosses. Smith et al. (1999) showed that the CHRD gene and the thrombopoietin gene (THPO; 600044) are located within a single cosmid clone; the 2 genes occupy a total of 21 kb and are transcribed from opposite strands using promoters separated by less than 2 kb. Smith et al. (1999) also showed that the human voltage-gated chloride-channel gene CLCN2 (600570) is located downstream of THPO but in the same transcriptional orientation. In addition, they had evidence that the eukaryotic translation initiation factor-4-gamma gene (EIF4G1; 600495) is located in the same region. Smith et al. (1999) considered that the CHRD gene and the chordin-regulating goosecoid gene (GSC; 138890) could be candidate genes for Cornelia de Lange syndrome (CDLS; 122470), which had been mapped to 3q. The GSC gene had been detected in close proximity to a 14q32 breakpoint detected in a CDLS patient with a balanced de novo translocation (Wilson et al., 1983). Mutation screening failed to identify CDLS patient-specific mutations in CHRD or GSC. The SOX2 gene (184429), which is located in the same region of chromosome 3, was also screened with negative results. ANIMAL MODEL Mouse chordin mRNA is first expressed in the anterior primitive streak and then in the node and axial mesoendoderm that derives from it, suggesting that chordin may play a role in patterning of the early embryo. However, targeted inactivation of chordin results in stillborn animals that have normal early development and neural induction but display later defects in inner and outer ear development and abnormalities in pharyngeal and cardiovascular organization. Bachiller et al. (2000) demonstrated that at midgastrula, expression of noggin (602991) overlaps that of chordin. Noggin mutants underwent normal gastrulation and anterior central nervous system patterning, although at later stages a number of abnormalities were observed in posterior spinal cord and somites. Bachiller et al. (2000) set up intercrosses between mice compound heterozygous for noggin and chordin mutations, but no double-homozygous mutants were recovered among the neonates. Two chordin/noggin double-null embryos were found among animals dissected close to term. Both were undergoing resorption, but clearly had holoprosencephaly, with a single nasal pit, a cyclopic eye, and agnathia. These malformations, not observed in either mutant on its own, represented the weakest phenotypes found in double-homozygous mice and resembled embryos lacking sonic hedgehog (SHH; 600725). At embryonic day 12.5, double-mutant embryos were recovered with more severe phenotypes resembling aprosencephaly. In double-mutant embryos dissected at embryonic day 8.5, forebrain reduction was clearly evident. Bachiller et al. (2000) concluded from these data that chordin and noggin are not necessary for establishing the anterior visceral endoderm but are required for subsequent elaboration of anterior pattern. Mesodermal development was also affected, indicated by the lack of shh. Bachiller et al. (2000) suggested that the BMP antagonists chordin and noggin compensate for each other during early mouse development. When both gene products are removed, antero-posterior, dorso-ventral, and left-right patterning are all affected. Ninomiya et al. (2004) demonstrated that the chordamesoderm of Xenopus possesses an intrinsic antero-posterior (AP) polarity that is necessary for convergent extension, functions in parallel to Wnt (see 164820)/planar cell polarity signaling, as demonstrated by T brachyury (601397) and chordin, and determines the direction of tissue elongation. The mechanism that establishes AP polarity involves activin (147290)-like signaling and directly links mesoderm AP patterning to convergent extension.

comment: A number sign (#) is used with this entry because limb-mammary syndrome can be caused by mutation in the TP63 gene (603273). Van Bokhoven et al. (1999) described a 'new' syndrome, which they designated limb-mammary syndrome, in a large Dutch family. The features were severe hand/foot anomalies and hypoplasia/aplasia of the mammary gland and nipple. Less frequent findings included lacrimal-duct atresia, nail dysplasia, hypohidrosis, hypodontia, and cleft palate with or without bifid uvula. Phenotypic overlap with the ulnar mammary syndrome (UMS; 181450), which is caused by mutation in the TBX3 gene (601621) on 12q24.1, as well as with the syndrome of ectrodactyly, ectodermal dysplasia, and clefting (EEC), 1 form of which maps to 7q (EEC1; 129900), was noted. Allelism with UMS and EEC1 was excluded by linkage studies with markers from the relevant chromosomal regions. A genomewide screening with polymorphic markers allowed the localization of the genetic defect to the subtelomeric region of 3q. Haplotype analysis reduced the critical region to a 3-cM interval of 3q27. Van Bokhoven et al. (1999) pointed to the SOX2 gene (184429) at 3q27 as an excellent candidate gene for LMS because the gene product stimulates expression of fibroblast growth factor-4 (FGF4; 164980), an important signaling molecule during limb outgrowth and development. However, they found no mutations in the SOX2 open reading frame. To investigate the possibility that EEC syndrome is allelic with LMS, Celli et al. (1999) used polymorphic markers from the 3q27 region for a linkage analysis in 5 families with EEC syndrome. Positive lod scores were obtained with markers from within the LMS interval for each of these families. The added Zmax across these families was 8.03 at marker D3S3530 at a recombination fraction theta = 0. Recombination events were observed between markers that define the LMS interval, D3S1580 and D3S1314, and the disease locus, indicating that these 5 EEC syndrome families map to the same 3-cM region of 3q27 that had been found for the LMS family reported by van Bokhoven et al. (1999). This colocalization and the overlapping clinical features of these disorders strongly suggested that the same gene is involved in this form of EEC syndrome (EEC3; 604292) and LMS. The critical region for EEC3/LMS was reduced to a 2.3-cM interval by a recombination event between marker D3S3530 and the genetic defect in EEC3 family Bri-1 (64:1 odds). Analysis of the p63 gene (603273), a homolog of p53 located in the critical LMS/EEC3 interval, revealed heterozygous mutations in 9 unrelated EEC3 families. No mutations were identified in the LMS family and several other EEC3 families mapping to 3q27. Celli et al. (1999) suggested that these mutations most likely reside in other parts of the p63 gene not yet analyzed, including exons 1 to 4 and 15. Because of the phenotypic similarity between a family with the ADULT syndrome (103285) described by Propping and Zerres (1993) and a family with LMS syndrome mapping to 3q27, Propping et al. (2000) genotyped 21 members of the family with ADULT syndrome with 19 polymorphic markers from the 3q27 chromosome region. Their studies placed the ADULT locus in the same chromosome region as the LMS locus, suggesting that these 2 conditions are allelic. Van Bokhoven et al. (2001) demonstrated mutations in the TP63 gene (603273) in 2 small kindreds with LMS.

comment: Borsani et al. (1999) presented the detailed characterization of a fourth vertebrate gene, designated EYA4, that is homologous to 'eyes absent' (eya), a key regulator of ocular development in Drosophila. See also EYA1 (601653), EYA2 (601654), and EYA3 (601655). The authors found that EYA4 encodes a 640-amino acid protein containing a highly conserved C-terminal domain of 271 amino acids. In Drosophila, eya is known to mediate developmentally important protein-protein interactions. By radiation hybrid analysis and fluorescence in situ hybridization, Borsani et al. (1999) mapped the human EYA4 gene to 6q23. They also detected linkage, with a lod score of greater than 3, to previously mapped reference markers. They genetically mapped the mouse Eya4 gene to chromosome 10 in the vicinity of Aco2 (100850), in a region homologous to human chromosome 6q22-q23. In the developing mouse embryo, Eya4 was expressed primarily in the craniofacial mesenchyme, the dermamyotome, and the limb. On the basis of map position and expression pattern, EYA4 was considered a candidate for oculodentodigital dysplasia (164200), but Borsani et al. (1999) found no EYA4 mutations in a panel of patients with this disorder. Wayne et al. (2001) identified mutations in the EYA4 gene that were responsible for postlingual, progressive, autosomal dominant hearing loss at the DFNA10 locus (601316). Just as EYA proteins interact with members of the SIX (601205) and DACH (603803) protein families during early embryonic development, the authors suggested that EYA4 is also important postdevelopmentally for continued function of the mature organ of Corti. In a kindred with dilated cardiomyopathy and heart failure preceded by sensorineural hearing loss mapping to 6q23-q24 (605362) previously described by Schonberger et al. (2000), Schonberger et al. (2005) performed fine mapping that narrowed the critical interval to a 2.0-Mb region containing 8 known genes and several EST clusters. Only 3 of these genes--EYA4, SGK (602958), and TCF21 (603306)--were expressed in both heart and cochlea. Screening of the coding sequences of these 3 genes in 2 affected family members identified a 4,846-bp deletion that encompassed the last nucleotide of exon 9, intron 9, exon 10, and part of intron 10 of the EYA4 gene (603550.0003). This deletion was present in all affected family members and absent from 300 control chromosomes. No other mutations were identified in the remaining 19 exons of EYA4 or in TCF21 or SGK. To elucidate the role of EYA4 in heart function, Schonberger et al. (2005) studied zebrafish embryos injected with antisense morpholino oligonucleotides. Attenuated Eya4 transcript levels produced morphologic and hemodynamic features of heart failure. To determine whether previously described mutated EYA4 alleles cause sensorineural hearing loss without heart disease, they examined biochemical interactions of mutant Eya4 peptides. Eya4 peptides associated with sensorineural hearing loss, but not the shortened 193-amino acid peptide associated with dilated cardiomyopathy and sensorineural hearing loss, bound wildtype Eya4 and associated with Six proteins (see 601205). Schonberger et al. (2005) concluded that these data defined unrecognized and crucial roles of Eya4-Six-mediated transcriptional regulation in normal heart function.

comment: A number sign (#) is used with this entry because of evidence that mutation in the protein kinase domain of titin (188840) can cause hereditary myopathy with early respiratory failure (HMERF). CLINICAL FEATURES Edstrom et al. (1990) described 16 individuals, from 7 families, who had autosomal dominant, adult-onset myopathy with early respiratory muscle involvement. All patients showed proximal weakness of the upper and lower extremities. In many patients, the respiratory muscles, especially the diaphragm, were involved. Neck flexors were typically affected, and foot extensor weakness was also present in some patients. The age at onset of significant symptoms varied from the second to the fifth decade, with an average age of approximately 35 years. The creatine kinase (CK) levels were normal or slightly elevated in all cases. Typical muscle biopsy samples showed, at the light microscopic level, cytoplasmic bodies that were highly positive for rhodamine-conjugated phalloidin. Rhodamine-conjugated phalloidin selectively binds to F-actin. At the ultrastructural level, these bodies were seen to be composed of thin filaments and dense material related to the Z-discs. MAPPING In 2 Swedish families with this disorder, Nicolao et al. (1999) established linkage of the phenotype to the chromosomal region 2q24-q31. A maximum combined 2-point lod score of 4.87 at a recombination fraction of 0.0 was obtained with marker D2S1245. Haplotype analysis indicated that the gene responsible for the disease is likely to be located in the 17-cM region between markers D2S2384 and D2S364. The affected individuals from these 2 families shared an identical haplotype, which suggested a common origin. Xiang et al. (1999) performed linkage analysis in a French family with similar clinical phenotype and findings on muscle biopsy to those in the Swedish families reported by Nicolao et al. (1999), and excluded linkage to the 2q24-q33 region. They conducted a genomewide scan in the French family using polymorphic microsatellite markers and obtained a maximum 2-point lod score of 2.11 (the highest lod score that could be achieved in this family) for markers in the 2q21 region. They suggested that there may be a second locus for this disorder in that region. MOLECULAR GENETICS Nicolao et al. (1999) considered the titin gene (TTN; 188840) to be a strong candidate. Titin, or connectin, is the largest polypeptide known and forms filaments that span from the Z-discs to the M-lines. The entire coding region of the gene (approximately 300 kb) maps within the candidate region demonstrated by Nicolao et al. (1999) for Edstrom myopathy. In the 2 Swedish families described by Nicolao et al. (1999) as well as in 1 additional Swedish patient with an identical phenotype, Lange et al. (2005) identified a C-to-T transition resulting in an arginine-to-tryptophan substitution at codon 279 of the titin gene (R279W; 188840.0011), which lies within alpha helix R1 (alpha-R1) of the protein kinase domain. The single patient had no known genealogic relationship to any of the 2 original families but had the same mutation on the same haplotype, indicating a common ancestry. Lange et al. (2005) found no difference in calmodulin (114180)-stimulated catalytic activity between recombinant R279W mutant titin kinase domain (TK) and wildtype. Because the R279W mutation in alpha-R1 results in a drastic change of a surface-exposed basic to a nonpolar, bulky amino acid in the NBR1 (166945) binding site, Lange et al. (2005) tested the interaction of TK with NBR1, which was dramatically reduced in the mutant protein kinase domain. In patient biopsies, NBR1 was localized abnormally diffusely in diseased muscle instead of being M band- and Z disk-associated, although in HMERF 50% of TK was expected to be wildtype. P62 (601530) accumulated in many diseased muscle fibers of HMERF patients. MURF2 (606469) showed unusual nuclear localization in centralized nuclei of patient muscle fibers not observed in peripheral nuclei of normal muscle or in 3 other myopathies with centralized nuclei (DMD, 310200; tibial muscular dystrophy, 600334; and myotubular myopathy, 310400). Furthermore, MURF1 (606131), a close homolog of MURF2, did not show nuclear localization in HMERF patients or in the other myopathies tested with centralized nuclei.

comment: DESCRIPTION Striated muscle sarcomeres are highly organized structures composed of actin (thin) and myosin (thick) filaments that slide past each other during contraction. The integrity of sarcomeres is controlled by a set of structural proteins, among which are titin (TTN; 188840), a giant molecule that contains several immunoglobulin (Ig)-like domains and associates with thin and thick filaments, and alpha-actinin (ACTN1; 102575), an actin cross-linking protein. Mutations in several sarcomeric and sarcolemmal proteins have been shown to result in muscular dystrophy and cardiomyopathy. CLONING Salmikangas et al. (1999) described a novel 57-kD cytoskeletal protein, myotilin. Its N-terminal sequence is unique, but the C-terminal half contains 2 Ig-like domains homologous to titin. They found that myotilin is expressed in skeletal and cardiac muscle, colocalizes with alpha-actinin in sarcomeric I-bands, and directly interacts with alpha-actinin. MAPPING By radiation hybrid mapping, Salmikangas et al. (1999) located the myotilin gene on 5q31 between markers AFM350yB1 and D5S500. The locus of a dominantly inherited limb-girdle muscular dystrophy, LGMD1A (159000), resides in an overlapping narrow segment, and a form of distal myopathy with vocal cord and pharyngeal weakness (158580) maps to the same region. Muscle specificity and apparent role as a sarcomeric structural protein raised the possibility that defects in the myotilin gene may cause muscular dystrophy. GENE FUNCTION Salmikangas et al. (2003) demonstrated that myotilin directly binds F-actin (see 102610), efficiently crosslinks actin filaments alone or in concert with alpha-actinin, and prevents filament disassembly induced by latrunculin A. Myotilin formed dimers via its C-terminal half, which may be necessary for the actin-bundling activity. Overexpression of full-length myotilin (but not the C-terminal half) induced formation of thick actin cables in nonmuscle cells devoid of endogenous myotilin. The expression of myotilin in muscle cells was tightly regulated to the later stages of in vitro myofibrillogenesis, when preassembled myofibrils began to align. Expression of either N- or C-terminally truncated myotilin fragments (but not wildtype myotilin) in differentiating myocytes led to myofibril disarray. Salmikangas et al. (2003) concluded that myotilin plays an indispensable role in stabilization and anchorage of thin filaments, which may be a prerequisite for correct Z-disc organization. MOLECULAR GENETICS Hauser et al. (2000) identified a mutation in the myotilin gene (T57I; 604103.0001) in a large North American family of German descent segregating LGMD1A. The mutant allele was transcribed, and normal levels of correctly localized myotilin protein were seen in LGMD1A muscle. The mutation did not disrupt binding to alpha-actinin. Selcen and Engel (2004) identified mutations in the TTID gene (604103.0002-604103.0005) in 6 of 57 patients with myofibrillar myopathy. The authors termed the disorder 'myotilinopathy' to distinguish it from other forms of myofibrillar myopathy. One of the mutations, ser55 to phe (S55F; 604103.0002), had previously been identified in a patient with LGMD1A. All of the mutations occurred in a serine residue in serine-rich exon 2 of the protein, suggesting it is a hotspot for mutation.

comment: A number sign (#) is used with this entry because of evidence that this form of autosomal dominant dilated cardiomyopathy (CMD), which maps to 2q31, is caused by mutations in the titin gene (TTN; 188840). For a general phenotypic description and a discussion of genetic heterogeneity of dilated cardiomyopathy, see CMD1A (115200). MAPPING Siu et al. (1999) clinically evaluated 3 generations of a Native American kindred with autosomal dominant transmission of dilated cardiomyopathy. Nine surviving affected individuals had early-onset disease (ventricular chamber dilatation during the teenage years and congestive heart failure during the third decade of life). The disease was nonpenetrant in 2 obligate carriers. By linkage analysis, Siu et al. (1999) identified a novel disease locus at marker D2S1244 on 2q31 (maximum lod = 4.06 at theta = 0.0) between the glucagon gene (138030) and marker D2S72; they designated this locus CMD1G. Because the massive gene encoding titin, a cytoskeletal muscle protein, resides in this disease interval, the authors analyzed sequences encoding 900-amino acid residues of the cardiac-specific (N2-B) domain of the gene. Although 5 sequence variants were identified, none segregated with the disease in this family. MOLECULAR GENETICS In 2 unrelated families with autosomal dominant dilated cardiomyopathy, Gerull et al. (2002) identified 2 different heterozygous mutations in the titin gene (188840.0002; 188840.0003). Both families showed reduced penetrance and no involvement of noncardiac muscle. The latter was surprising since exons of TTN that contain the 2 CMD-causing mutations are both expressed in cardiac and noncardiac muscle isoforms. In 4 patients with dilated cardiomyopathy, Itoh-Satoh et al. (2002) identified 4 different mutations in the TTN gene (188840.0007-188840.0010). Two of the cases were familial.

comment: DESCRIPTION Telethonin is a sarcomeric protein of 19 kD found exclusively in striated and cardiac muscle (Valle et al., 1997). It appears to be localized to the Z-disc of adult skeletal muscle and cultured myocytes. Telethonin is a substrate of titin (TTN; 188840), which acts as a molecular 'ruler' for the assembly of the sarcomere by providing spatially defined binding sites for other sarcomeric proteins. After activation by phosphorylation and calcium/calmodulin binding, titin phosphorylates the C-terminal domain of telethonin in early differentiating myocytes. MAPPING Valle et al. (1997) mapped the telethonin gene to 17q12, adjacent to the phenylethanolamine N-methyltransferase gene (171190). MOLECULAR GENETICS Moreira et al. (2000) found that mutations in the telethonin gene cause limb-girdle muscular dystrophy type 2G (LGMD2G; 601954), an autosomal recessive disorder. In a patient with CMD1N (607487), Knoll et al. (2002) identified an arg87-to-gln mutation (R87Q; 604488.0003) in the TCAP gene.

comment: DESCRIPTION SRY-related HMG-box (SOX) genes encode a family of DNA-binding proteins containing a 79-amino acid HMG (high mobility group) domain that shares at least 50% sequence identity with the DNA-binding HMG box of the SRY protein (480000). SOX proteins are divided into 6 subgroups based on sequence similarity within and outside of the HMG domain. For additional background information on SOX genes, see SOX1 (602148). CLONING By PCR of human genomic DNA using highly degenerate oligonucleotides designed to amplify HMG box-related sequences, Cremazy et al. (1998) identified several novel SOX proteins, including SOX14, which they called SOX28. The partial SOX14 sequence encodes a deduced protein with an HMG box-like domain sharing 57% sequence identity with the SRY HMG box. Like the HMG box of SRY, the HMG box-like domain of SOX28 contains a putative nuclear localization signal. By screening a genomic library using a SRY box-containing probe, Arsic et al. (1998) isolated the human SOX14 gene, which contains an HMG box identical to that of the partially characterized mouse Sox14 gene. The human SOX14 gene encodes a deduced 240-amino acid, proline-rich protein that contains several phosphorylation sites and a potential N-glycosylation site. The protein shows high similarity (87 to 92%) to the HMG-box region of other SOX proteins of the B subfamily, but lacks any similarity to those proteins outside of the HMG box. Northern blot analysis revealed expression of an approximately 1.8-kb SOX14 transcript in the liver-derived HepG2 cell line. With RT-PCR, expression was detectable in fetal brain, spinal cord, and thymus, with a lower level of expression in fetal adrenals and adult heart, liver, gut, kidney, and testes. Hargrave et al. (2000) also reported the cloning and sequencing of the human ortholog of mouse and chick Sox14. They found that human SOX14 showed remarkable sequence conservation compared with orthologs from other vertebrate species and probably mirrored the expression of these genes in the developing brain and spinal cord. Wilmore et al. (2000) stated that the SOX14 gene most closely resembles SOX21 (604974) with respect to nucleotide and amino acid sequence (Malas et al., 1999). Wilmore et al. (2000) found that the SOX14 amino acid sequence is highly conserved across human, mouse, and chicken orthologs, suggesting an important role for this protein in vertebrate development. SOX14 is expressed in the neural tube and apical ectodermal ridge of the developing chicken limb. Wilmore et al. (2000) stated that SOX14 is the only SOX gene known to be expressed in the apical ectodermal ridge, a structure that directs outgrowth of the embryonic limb bud. GENE STRUCTURE Wilmore et al. (2000) stated that both the SOX14 and SOX21 genes appear to be encoded by a single exon. Arsic et al. (1998) determined that the SOX14 gene is intronless. MAPPING By fluorescence in situ hybridization (FISH), Arsic et al. (1998) mapped the SOX14 gene to chromosome 3q22-q23. By radiation hybrid analysis, they mapped the gene 3.46 cR distal to D3S1549 and proximal to D3S1576. Using radiation hybrid mapping and FISH, Hargrave et al. (2000) localized the SOX14 gene close to marker D3S1576 on 3q23. By FISH, Wilmore et al. (2000) mapped the SOX14 gene to 3q and further narrowed the assignment by screening a panel of YAC clones. They found that the SOX14 gene is localized to a 1.15-Mb YAC on 3q23, close to loci for blepharophimosis, ptosis, and epicanthus inversus syndrome (BPES; 110100) and Moebius syndrome (MBS2; 601471).

comment: DESCRIPTION The testis-determining gene SRY (480000) encodes a transcription factor characterized by a DNA-binding motif known as the HMG (high mobility group) box. The SOX gene family consists of genes related to SRY, with a sequence identity of more than 60% to the SRY HMG box. See 600898. CLONING Kido et al. (1998) cloned Sox13 cDNA from a mouse 8.5-day embryo cDNA library and found that expression in the adult mouse is restricted to kidney and ovary. Roose et al. (1998) independently cloned a full-length mouse Sox13 cDNA and found that high expression of Sox13 is restricted to arteries during late embryogenesis. They also found that Sox13 binds to the consensus HMG-box motif, AACAAAG, but does not transactivate transcription from multimeric sites. By screening a human fetal kidney cDNA library with mouse Sox13 cDNA as a probe, Roose et al. (1999) isolated a human SOX13 cDNA. The deduced SOX13 protein has 890 amino acids with a centrally located HMG box and an N-terminal leucine zipper motif with a neighboring glutamine stretch called a Q box. The protein shares 75% homology with mouse Sox13. Sequence homology with other SOX proteins indicates that SOX13 is a member of subfamily D. Northern blot analysis applied to human fetal tissue samples revealed high expression of SOX13 in kidney, lung, and liver and low expression in thymus, brain, spleen, and muscle. GENE FUNCTION Using sera from patients with insulin-dependent diabetes mellitus (IDDM) to screen a human islet cDNA library, Rabin et al. (1992) determined that the SOX13 protein, which they termed ICA12, is an IDDM-specific human autoantigen. MAPPING By fluorescence in situ hybridization, Roose et al.

Like the HMG box of SRY, the HMG box-like domain of SOX21 contains a putative nuclear localization signal. By screening a human genomic library with a mouse Sox1 probe, Malas et al.

The protein is highly homologous to SOX14 (604747), showing 92% identity within the N-terminal HMG box and 66% identity within a 50-amino acid C-terminal domain. It also shares 89% amino acid sequence identity with the chicken SOX21 protein. By Northern blot analysis, Malas et al. (1999) showed that SOX21 is expressed in human embryonic brain as a 5-kb transcript, similar to the chicken ortholog of SOX21. GENE FUNCTION In the chick embryo, Sandberg et al. (2005) found Sox21 promoted neuronal differentiation by counteracting the activity of Sox1, Sox2 (184429), and Sox3 (313430), which maintains neural cells in an undifferentiated state. The authors concluded that the balance between SOX21 and SOX1, SOX2, and SOX3 activities determines whether neural cells remain as progenitors or commit to differentiation.

The SOX gene family consists of genes related to SRY, with a sequence identity of more than 60% to the SRY HMG box. See 600898. CLONING By screening a human adult testis cDNA library with a mouse Sox5 cDNA fragment containing the HMG box, Wunderle et al. (1996) isolated several SOX5 cDNAs that share a 1.4-kb region encoding a predicted 347-amino acid protein. The deduced mouse and human SOX5 proteins have 97% sequence similarity and an identical HMG box. The SOX5 cDNA clones have variable 5-prime regions resulting from differential splicing. Unlike the testis-specific expression of the mouse Sox5 gene, expression of the human SOX5 gene is detectable by RT-PCR in various tissues including adult testis, heart, liver, lung, kidney, spleen, and fetal brain. By Northern blot analysis, Wunderle et al. (1996) detected a 1.8-kb SOX5 transcript in adult testis, but a larger transcript in fetal brain, suggesting that SOX5 is subject to tissue-specific differential splicing. GENE FUNCTION Connor et al. (1995) determined that the HMG domains of mouse Sox5 and Sox6 (607257) bind to the sequence 5-prime-AACAAT-3-prime. Lefebvre et al. (1998) reported that a long form of Sox5 (L-Sox5), Sox6, and Sox9 (608160) are coexpressed during mouse chondrogenesis. They identified a coiled-coil domain located in L-Sox5 and Sox6 that mediates protein dimerization and efficient binding to adjacent HMG DNA sites. In cotransfection experiments, Lefebvre et al. (1998) observed that L-Sox5, Sox6, and Sox9 cooperatively activated expression of Col2a1 (120140), a chondrocyte differentiation marker. Using gene targeting, Smits et al. (2001) generated null mutations of the Sox5 and Sox6 genes in mice to investigate the genes' role in cartilage formation. They observed that both Sox5 and Sox6 single gene null mutations were early lethal and that the mice had mild skeletal abnormalities that affected the size and mineralization rate of a small, distinct subset of endochondral elements. Sox5-deficient mice died at birth with respiratory distress. They had cleft secondary palate, a short chondrocranium, and a small thoracic cage. Also, mineralization of some endochondral elements was slightly delayed. In contrast to the single gene null mice, the Sox5/Sox6 double null embryos died in utero with a severe, generalized chondrodysplasia. Using detailed histology and gene expression analysis, Smits et al. (2001) concluded that L-Sox5 and Sox6 are redundant enhancers of chondroblast functions, controlling both expression of extracellular matrix genes and cell proliferation. Zafarana et al. (2002) identified the DADR (609860), SOX5, and ETNK1 (609858) genes within a region of chromosome 12p amplified in testicular seminomas (273300). Although all 3 genes were amplified to the same level in seminomas with the amplification, only DADR expression was significantly upregulated. MAPPING By FISH, Wunderle et al. (1996) mapped the SOX5 gene to chromosome 12p12.1, a region that shows homology of synteny to mouse chromosome 6 where the murine Sox5 gene is located. Wunderle et al. (1996) also identified a processed pseudogene of SOX5 that contains multiple mutations and in-frame stop codons and maps to chromosome 8q21.1.

comment: During neural induction, the organizer of the vertebrate embryo instructs neighboring ectodermal cells to become nervous system rather than epidermis. This process was generally thought to occur around the midgastrula stage of embryogenesis. Streit et al. (2000) isolated a novel gene, which they called Erni (early response to neural induction), from chick, zebrafish, and quail. Erni contains a putative coiled-coil domain and a tyrosine phosphorylation site. When transfected into COS cells, Erni protein was found throughout the cytoplasm in most cells, but was restricted to the nucleus in about 10% of cells. These cells were invariably smaller and fibroblast-like. Chick Erni begins to be expressed at preprimitive streak stages throughout the region that will contribute to the nervous system. By streak stages, its distribution coincides with the known limits of the prospective neural plate. Shortly thereafter, expression clears from the center of the neural plate and becomes confined to its border; transcripts disappear by early somite stages. A quail Hensen node induced chick Erni expression in extraembryonic epiblast in as little as 1 to 2 hours. These observations made chick Erni the earliest known marker for response to organizer signals, even earlier than SOX3 (313430). Fibroblast growth factor-8 (FGF8; 600483)-coated beads induced expression of chick Erni as early and as quickly as did the node, i.e., within 1 to 2 hours. FGF8 also strongly induced the expression of SOX3, but not the later neural marker SOX2 (184429). Streit et al. (2000) considered FGF8 to be the best candidate endogenous inducer, because at primitive streak stages it is expressed in the anterior part of the streak, including the node, and is downregulated as the node begins to lose neural-inducing ability. FGF inhibitors reduced the frequency of induction by a graft node, implicating FGF signaling as an essential component of the neural induction pathway initiated by the organizer. Additional observations indicated that neural induction is initiated before the beginning of gastrulation by FGF emanating from a population of organizer precursors at the posterior margin at the embryo. The coming together of this cell population with a second precursor population in the epiblast generates a full functional organizer that provides the remaining signals in a cascade, including bone morphogenetic protein (BMP) antagonists.

comment: For background information on chemokines, see CXCL11 (SCYB11; 604852). CLONING Using a 2-step EST database search in which putative transcripts were scanned for the occurrence of functional patterns, Matloubian et al. (2000) identified a cDNA encoding a CXC chemokine that they termed CXCL16. The predicted 273-amino acid CXCL16 protein, which is 49% identical to the 246-amino acid mouse sequence, contains a non-glu/leu/arg (ELR) motif-containing CXC chemokine domain, a mucin-like spacer region, a transmembrane domain, and a cytoplasmic tail with a potential tyrosine phosphorylation and SH2 protein-binding site. CXCL16 was the first transmembrane CXC chemokine identified; CX3CL1 (SCYD1; 601880), which also has a mucin-like spacer region, was the only other known transmembrane chemokine. Northern blot analysis of mouse and human tissues detected a 2.2-kb CXCL16 transcript in spleen, lymph nodes, Peyer patches, lung, kidney, small intestine, and thymus, with weak expression in heart and liver and no expression in brain and bone marrow. Flow cytometry and Western blot analysis demonstrated expression of an approximately 60-kD glycosylated cell-surface protein as well as a cell supernatant 35-kD soluble protein. By expression cloning from a phorbol ester-stimulated THP-1 cell library, Shimaoka et al. (2000) isolated a cDNA encoding SRPSOX (scavenger receptor that binds phophatidylserine and oxidized lipoprotein). The deduced 254-amino acid type I transmembrane protein is identical to the CXCL16 protein reported by Matloubian et al. (2000) except that SRPSOX differs by 2 residues and lacks the N-terminal 19 amino acids. Immunoblot analysis showed that SRPSOX is expressed as a 30-kD protein in human and mouse macrophages. Northern blot analysis revealed differentiation-inducible expression of 1.8- and 2.5-kb transcripts in macrophages. Wilbanks et al. (2001) cloned and characterized CXCL16. They concluded that the alpha chemokine contains 254 amino acids and that efficient secretion occurs without the long signal peptide predicted by Matloubian et al. (2000). Flow cytometric analysis demonstrated expression of CXCL16 on B cells and monocytes. GENE FUNCTION By flow cytometry of cells from mouse tissues, Matloubian et al. (2000) found that CXCL16 was present on CD11C (ITGAX; 151510)-positive splenic and lymph node dendritic cells; this expression was increased after injection with lipopolysaccharide. Immunohistochemical analysis showed that CXCL16 was expressed in T-cell areas of the splenic white pulp, lymph nodes, the thymus medulla, and in the splenic red pulp; no staining was observed in B-cell areas. After injection of inflammatory mediators, expression was enhanced in T-cell zones and, more prominently, in splenic red pulp. Chemotaxis assays found that CXCL16 induced a strong chemotactic response in activated CD8 T cells. In addition, CXCL16 induced calcium mobilization. Human and mouse cells expressing CXCR6 (605163) showed a strong chemotactic response to CXCL16 but not to other chemokines. Matloubian et al. (2000) concluded that CXCL16 and CXCR6 probably function in interactions between dendritic cells and T cells and in regulating T-cell migration in the splenic red pulp. Macrophages endocytose oxidized low density lipoprotein (OxLDL) by a receptor-mediated mechanism. Shimaoka et al. (2000) found that cells expressing SRPSOX bound to phophatidylserine-coated plates; this binding could be inhibited by OxLDL. Scatchard analysis confirmed that SRPSOX is a specific receptor for OxLDL but not LDL or acetyl-LDL. Fluorescence microscopy demonstrated OxLDL uptake in SRPSOX-expressing cells. Wilbanks et al. (2001) found that stimulation of macrophages with lipopolysaccharide or TNF induced rapid shedding of CXCL16 into the culture supernatant. By transfecting human and murine cell lines with CXCL16 cDNA, followed by treatment with specific ADAM inhibitors, Abel et al. (2004) determined that ADAM10 (602192), but not ADAM17 (603639), is involved in constitutive cleavage of the transmembrane adhesion molecule CXCL16 to a soluble chemoattractant for activated T cells. Constitutive cleavage was markedly reduced in Adam10-deficient mouse fibroblasts and was restored by retransfection with ADAM10. CXCL16 induction in vascular cells was dependent on synergistic activity of IFNG (147570) and TNFA (191160). Abel et al. (2004) concluded that ADAM10 is the most relevant sheddase of CXCL16. MAPPING By somatic cell hybrid analysis, Matloubian et al. (2000) mapped the CXCL16 gene to 17p13, a locus separate from all other known chemokines.

SOX proteins are divided into several subgroups based on sequence similarity within and outside of the HMG domain. For additional background information on SOX genes, see SOX1 (602148). CLONING By genomic sequence and EST database searching with a segment of the SOX9 gene as query, Pfeifer et al. (2000) identified a novel member of the group E SOX gene family, SOX8. The deduced 446-amino acid protein shares 47% overall sequence identity with 2 other group E members, SOX9 (608160) and SOX10 (602229), and is identical except for 1 amino acid to the mouse Sox8 protein. Northern blot analysis detected expression of a 3.4-kb mRNA that was most abundant in brain and less abundant in heart, skeletal muscle, and pancreas. MAPPING Pfeifer et al. (2000) found the SOX8 sequence in a contig located within 2 Mb from the tip of chromosome 16p, and they narrowed the region within 700 kb of the telomeric repeats of band 16p13.3. They confirmed this localization by FISH. GENE FUNCTION The SOX8 gene lies in a region of chromosome 16 that has been shown to be deleted in cases of the deletion type of alpha-thalassemia/mental retardation syndrome (ATR-16 syndrome; 141750), a contiguous gene deletion syndrome. Pfeifer et al. (2000) stated that the SOX8 gene was found to be deleted in a patient with ATR-16 syndrome who carried a deletion of approximately 2 Mb from 16p13.3. Based on the high expression of SOX8 in the brain, they suggested that haploinsufficiency for the SOX8 protein could contribute to the mental retardation found in ATR-16 syndrome. ANIMAL MODEL Using homologous recombination in embryonic stem cells, Sock et al. (2001) generated mice deficient in SOX8. The simultaneous replacement of the Sox8 gene by a lacZ marker allowed them to monitor Sox8 expression closely during development. Despite strong expression of Sox8 in many tissues, including neural crest, nervous system, muscle, cartilage, adrenal gland, kidney, testis, eye, ear, and nose, homozygous mice developed normally in utero, were born at mendelian frequencies, and were viable. Sock et al. (2001) observed a substantial reduction in weight in these mice and hypothesized that the low weight was due to physiologic or metabolic differences. They hypothesized that the mild phenotype of Sox8-deficient mice might be due in part to functional redundancy between subgroup E Sox proteins.

comment: Rab proteins are small GTPases of the Ras superfamily involved in the regulation of intracellular membrane trafficking. For additional background information on Rab proteins, see 179508. The RAB23 gene encodes an essential negative regulator of the Sonic hedgehog (SHH; 600725) signaling pathway. CLONING By a map-based approach, Eggenschwiler et al. (2001) cloned the gene mutant in the mouse 'open brain 'phenotype (opb; see later) and found that it encodes Rab23, a member of the Rab family of vesicle transport proteins. The human RAB23 gene encodes a 237-amino acid protein. RAB23 is 30 to 35% identical to other mammalian Rab proteins and includes all the canonical motifs required for guanine nucleotide binding, GTP hydrolysis, membrane association, and the conformational switch between the GTP and GDP-bound state. Rab23 is a relatively divergent Rab protein with an unusually long carboxy-terminal tail. In the mouse at embryonic day 10.5, Rab23 RNA was present at low levels in most tissues, and was present at high levels in the spinal cord, somites, limb buds, and cranial mesenchyme. In the spinal cord, Rab23 was expressed at highest levels in the dorsal half of the neural tube, although it was excluded from the roof plate. In the limb bud, it was expressed in the crescent of mesenchymal cells that are capable of responding to Shh signaling. The expression pattern of Rab23 RNA is similar to that of Gli3 (165240), another negative regulator of the Shh signaling pathway. GENE FUNCTION Mutations in Shh and opb cause opposing transformations in neural cell fate: Shh mutant embryos lack ventral cell types throughout the spinal cord, whereas opb mutant embryos lack dorsal cell types specifically in the caudal spinal cord. Eggenschwiler et al. (2001) demonstrated that opb acts downstream of Shh. Ventral cell types that are absent in Shh mutants, including the floor plate, are present in Shh-opb double mutants. The organization of ventral cell types in Shh-opb double mutants reveals that Shh-independent mechanisms can pattern the neural tube along its dorsal-ventral axis. Eggenschwiler et al. (2001) concluded that dorsalizing signals activate transcription of Rab23 in order to silence the Shh pathway in dorsal neural cells. MAPPING By database searching, Zhang et al. (2000) mapped the RAB23 gene to chromosome 6p11 based on similarity between the RAB23 sequence (GenBank GENBANK AF161486) and previously mapped sequences. ANIMAL MODEL Mouse embryos homozygous for mutations in the 'open brain' (opb) gene die during the second half of gestation, with an open neural tube in the head and spinal cord, abnormal somites, polydactyly, and poorly developed eyes. The opb1 allele encodes a lys-to-ter mutation at codon 39; the opb2 allele encodes an arg-to-ter mutation at codon 80. These alleles would lack the domains required for guanine nucleotide and Rab effector binding and are therefore null alleles.

comment: The hedgehog (Hh) gene family (see 600725) encodes signaling molecules that play an important role in regulating morphogenesis. Mammalian hedgehog genes share striking homology to the Drosophila segment polarity gene hedgehog, a key regulator of pattern formation in the embryonic and adult fly. The hedgehog-interacting protein is a regulatory component in the vertebrate Hh signaling pathway. CLONING Chuang and McMahon (1999) cloned a mouse hedgehog-interacting protein cDNA from a limb bud cDNA expression library. They determined that the Hip cDNA encodes a type I transmembrane glycoprotein, which is expressed in all hedgehog target tissues and binds all 3 mammalian hedgehog proteins (SHH, 600725; IHH, 600726; DHH, 605423) with an affinity similar to that of the Ptc protein (601309), which is also a component of the Hh signaling pathway. Like Ptc, Hip expression is upregulated in response to Hh signaling. Ectopic expression of Hip in transgenic mice results in severe skeletal defects similar to those observed in Indian hedgehog (IHH) mutants, demonstrating that Hip is involved in the attenuation of hedgehog signaling. By database searching with the mouse Hip sequence as query, followed by RT-PCR and RACE analysis using human adult testis cDNA, Bak et al. (2001) cloned a HIP cDNA encoding a deduced 700-amino acid protein that shares 94% sequence identity with mouse Hip. By RT-PCR analysis, HIP expression was detected in all fetal and adult tissues examined except fetal ovary and at very low levels in placenta. GENE STRUCTURE Bak et al. (2001) determined that the HIP gene contains 13 exons and spans more than 91 kb of genomic DNA. The HIP promoter lacks a well-defined TATA box but has 2 CpG islands located in the promoter and 5-prime untranslated regions. A cAMP response element (CRE) is located just upstream of the transcription start site. MAPPING By radiation hybrid analysis, Bak et al. (2001) mapped the human HIP gene to chromosome 4q31.21-q31.3 and the mouse counterpart to chromosome 8 in a region of syntenic homology to human 4q28-q32.

comment: DESCRIPTION Motor neurons are among the earliest neurons to appear after the commencement of cell patterning and the beginning of cell differentiation. Differentiation occurs in a ventral-to-dorsal gradient and is mediated, at least in part, by the concentration of ventrally expressed sonic hedgehog protein (SHH; 600725). Dorsally expressed factors, such as members of the bone morphogenic protein (e.g., BMP4; 112262) and transforming growth factor-beta (e.g., TGFB1; 190180) families, can repress the induction of these neurons. CRIM1 may interact with growth factors implicated in motor neuron differentiation and survival (Kolle et al., 2000). CLONING Using a yeast 2-hybrid screen of a fetal kidney cDNA library with the WT1 transcription factor (607102) as bait, followed by screening a fetal brain cDNA library, searching a sequence database, and PCR of a gridded PAC library, Kolle et al. (2000) isolated cDNAs encoding human and mouse CRIM1. Sequence analysis predicted that the 1,036-amino acid human protein, which is 89% identical to the nearly complete mouse sequence, contains a signal peptide, an insulin-like growth factor-binding protein (IGFBP; see 602867)-like domain, 6 highly conserved VWFC cysteine-rich repeat domains, a transmembrane domain, and a 76-residue cytoplasmic tail. Northern blot analysis revealed an approximately 6.0-kb CRIM1 transcript in placenta, pancreas, kidney, skeletal muscle, lung, brain, and heart, but not in liver. Kolle et al. (2000) found that expression of Crim1 in embryonic mice peaked at day 13.5 postcoitum. In situ hybridization analysis of embryonic mice detected expression after the commencement of Shh expression in various tissues, including brain and spinal cord, from day 9.0 postcoitum. Kolle et al. (2000) proposed that CRIM1 may be involved in motor neuron survival by interacting with various growth factors. GENE STRUCTURE Genomic sequence analysis determined that the CRIM1 gene contains 17 exons, 16 of which span 236 kb, and reads in the telomere-to-centromere direction, opposite that of FEZ2 (604826). MAPPING By radiation hybrid analysis and FISH, Kolle et al. (2000) mapped the CRIM1 gene to 2p22-p21, close to the SPG4 (604277) locus.

comment: CLONING Based on amino acid sequence homology and common genomic exon/intron organization (Goulding et al., 1991), Burri et al. (1989) suggested that the human homolog of the mouse Pax3 gene is the HUP2 gene. Goulding et al. (1991) found that the product of the mouse Pax3 gene is a DNA-binding protein expressed during early neurogenesis. The HuP2 sequence contains 3 exons, which Tassabehji et al. (1992) designated exons 2, 3, and 4 because of their correspondence with exons 2, 3, and 4 of the mouse Pax3 gene, which has 5 exons. Tsukamoto et al. (1994) cloned PAX3 by 5-prime and 3-prime RACE of an adult cerebellum cDNA library. They identified 2 alternatively spliced isoforms, which they called PAX3A and PAX3B. The deduced PAX3A and PAX3B transcription factors contain 215 and 206 amino acids, respectively. RT-PCR detected high PAX3B expression in esophagus and stomach, with moderate levels in cerebellum, liver, and pancreas. PAX3B was not detected in lung, ovary, uterus, and cardiac muscle. PAX3A was expressed only in cerebellum, esophagus, and skeletal muscle. Barber et al. (1999) cloned PAX3 from a skeletal muscle cDNA library. They also cloned mouse Pax3. Barber et al. (1999) identified several alternatively spliced isoforms in adult skeletal muscle and in mouse embryos, including 1 that shares significant evolutionary conservation between quail, mouse, and human. GENE FUNCTION Bondurand et al. (2000) showed that SOX10 (602229), in synergy with PAX3, strongly activates MITF (156845) expression in transfection assays. Transfection experiments revealed that PAX3 and SOX10 interact directly by binding to a proximal region of the MITF promoter containing binding sites for both factors. Mutant SOX10 or PAX3 proteins failed to transactivate this promoter, providing further evidence that the 2 genes act in concert to directly regulate expression of MITF. In situ hybridization experiments carried out in the dominant megacolon (Dom) mouse confirmed that SOX10 dysfunction impaired Mitf expression as well as melanocytic development and survival. The authors hypothesized that interaction between 3 of the genes that are altered in Waardenburg syndrome (see 193500) could explain the auditory/pigmentary symptoms of this disease. Mutations in the MITF and PAX3 genes, encoding transcriptions factors, are responsible for Waardenburg syndrome II (WS2; 193510) and WS1 (193500)/WS3 (148820), respectively. Tachibana et al. (1996) showed that MITF transactivates the gene for tyrosinase (see 606933), a key enzyme for melanogenesis, and is critically involved in melanocyte differentiation. Absence of melanocytes affects pigmentation in the skin, hair, and eyes, and hearing function in the cochlea. Therefore, hypopigmentation and hearing loss in WS2 are likely to be the results of an anomaly of melanocyte differentiation caused by MITF mutations. Watanabe et al. (1998) showed that PAX3 transactivates the MITF promoter. They further showed that PAX3 proteins associated with WS1 in either the paired domain or the homeodomain failed the recognize and transactivate the MITF promoter. These results provided evidence that PAX3 directly regulates MITF, and suggested that the failure of this regulation due to PAX3 mutations causes the auditory-pigmentary symptoms in at least some individuals with WS1. Ridgeway and Skerjanc (2001) showed that expression of Pax3 induced myogenesis in a mouse pluripotent stem cell line. Pax3 induced expression of the transcription factor Six1 (601205), its cofactor Eya2 (601654), and the transcription factor Mox1 (600147), prior to inducing expression of MyoD (159970) and myogenin (159980). Expression of dominant-negative Pax3 resulted in loss of expression of Six1, Eya2, and endogenous Pax3, as well as downregulation of Mox1 expression. Pax3 expression had no effect on cardiogenesis in this cell line. Ridgeway and Skerjanc (2001) concluded that Pax3 controls a cascade of transcriptional events that are necessary and sufficient for skeletal myogenesis. The Sox10 and Pax3 transcription factors can directly regulate both MITF and RET (164761) in a synergistic fashion. Lang and Epstein (2003) showed that Pax3 and Sox10 can physically interact; this interaction contributes to synergistic activation of a conserved RET enhancer, and it explains why Sox10 mutants that cannot bind DNA still retain the ability to activate this enhancer in the presence of Pax3. However, in the context of the MITF gene, Pax3 and Sox10 must each bind independently to DNA in order to achieve synergy. These observations appear to explain the phenotype in the mild form of Yemenite deaf-blind syndrome caused by a specific SOX10 mutation (602229.0005) in the HMG box that abrogates DNA binding without disrupting association with PAX3. Pritchard et al. (2003) identified an alternatively spliced isoform of mouse Pax3 produced by skipping exon 8. Deletion of exon 8 removes most of the Pax3 transcriptional activation domain. Pritchard et al. (2003) demonstrated that this isoform is transcriptionally inactive, but it can inhibit the activity of the full-length protein. Relaix et al. (2005) identified a new cell population that expresses the transcription factors Pax3 and Pax7 (167410) but no skeletal muscle-specific markers. These cells are maintained as a proliferating population in embryonic and fetal muscles of the trunk and limbs throughout development. Using a stable green fluorescent protein (GFP) reporter targeted to Pax3, Relaix et al. (2005) demonstrated that they constitute resident muscle progenitor cells that subsequently become myogenic and form skeletal muscle. Late in fetal development, these cells adopt a satellite cell position characteristic of progenitor cells in postnatal muscle. In the absence of both Pax3 and Pax7, further muscle development is arrested and only the early embryonic muscle of the myotome forms. Cells failing to express Pax3 or Pax7 die or assume a nonmyogenic fate. Relaix et al. (2005) concluded that this resident Pax3/Pax7-dependent progenitor cell population constitutes a source of myogenic cells of prime importance for skeletal muscle formation. Lang et al. (2005) described the molecular details of a nodal point in adult melanocyte stem cell differentiation in which PAX3 simultaneously functions to initiate a melanogenic cascade while acting downstream to prevent terminal differentiation. PAX3 activates expression of MITF (156845) while at the same time it competes with MITF for occupancy of an enhancer required for expression of dopachrome tautomerase (191275), an enzyme that functions in melanin synthesis. PAX3-expressing melanoblasts are thus committed but undifferentiated until PAX3-mediated repression is relieved by activated beta-catenin (see 116806). Thus, Lang et al. (2005) concluded that a stem cell transcription factor can both determine cell fate and simultaneously maintain an undifferentiated state, leaving a cell poised to differentiate in response to external stimuli. GENE STRUCTURE Macina et al. (1995) determined that the PAX3 gene contains 8 exons and spans more than 100 kb. Analysis of the intronic translocation breakpoint region associated with alveolar rhabdomyosarcoma (268220) revealed a pair of inverted Alu repeats and a pair of inverted (GT)n-rich microsatellite repeats. The 5-prime region contains a microsatellite, putative CAAT, TATA, and CAP sites, and several binding sites for AP1 (see 165160) and SP1 (189906). Barber et al. (1999) determined that the PAX3 gene contains 10 exons. MAPPING By analysis of an inversion breakpoint associated with Waardenburg syndrome type I, Tsukamoto et al. (1992) and Ishikiriyama (1993) mapped the PAX3 gene to chromosome 2q35. CYTOGENETICS Tsukamoto et al. (1992) cloned and characterized an inversion breakpoint of the inv(2)(q35q37.3) paracentric inversion reported by Ishikiriyama et al. (1989) in a child with Waardenburg syndrome type I. Genomic cosmid clones containing the HUP2 gene were isolated from a library constructed from the patient's DNA. One of the clones contained the inversion breakpoint and revealed signals at both 2q35 and 2q37 by fluorescence in situ hybridization, indicating that the HUP2 gene had been disrupted by the inversion. The results suggested that the gene is situated at the more proximal breakpoint 2q35 because one cosmid clone, presumably derived from the normal allele, hybridized only to 2q35. MOLECULAR GENETICS To identify patient-specific mutations in the human gene, Tassabehji et al. (1992) designed primers to amplify exons of the gene and tested for heteroduplex formation on polyacrylamide gels. Variant bands were seen in 6 of 17 unrelated Waardenburg syndrome type I patients. Three of the variants were seen in exon 2, 2 in exon 3, and 1 in exon 4. No variants were seen in any exon in 50 normal controls. In 3 families that were tested, the variant was found to be familial in 2 and apparently de novo in the third. The variant bands showed perfect linkage to WS in the families studied. The HuP2 sequence showed 92% nucleotide homology and 100% amino acid homology with the mouse Pax3 sequence over amino acids 2 to 121. In 1 family, an 18-bp deletion was found in the central region of exon 2, resulting in loss of amino acids 29 to 34. The deleted sequence ran between 2 directly repeated GGCCC sequences. Another family had a small change, either a point mutation or a very small deletion, in exon 2 and a third family had a deletion in exon 4. In a large Brazilian family reported by da-Silva (1991), Baldwin et al. (1992) likewise identified a mutation in the HuP2 gene. There were 49 persons in 6 generations in whom the diagnosis of WS1 had been made. More than 78% of the affected members had noticeable hearing loss. Single-strand conformation polymorphism analysis suggested a sequence variation in exon 2 in affected members. Sequencing of exon 2 showed that there were 2 bands (G/A) 64 bp downstream from the 5-prime end of exon 2. The G band at this position corresponded to the normal sequence in the antisense strand, whereas the unusual A residue substituted the second base of a pro codon (CCG), making it a codon for a leu residue (CTG) in the sense strand. The single base substitution at this position destroyed a HaeIII restriction site in HuP2 exon 2. All 26 affected members of the family were heterozygous for the HaeIII site, whereas all 34 unaffected members and 50 control subjects were homozygous for the presence of the HaeIII site. Baldwin et al. (1992) did not detect the pro-to-leu mutation in 17 unrelated WS1 families. Baldwin et al. (1995) described 10 additional mutations in the PAX3 gene in families with WS type I. Eight of these mutations were in a region of PAX3 where only 1 mutation had previously been described. Taken together with previously reported mutations, these mutations covered essentially the entire PAX3 gene. All but 1 of the mutations were 'private;' only 1 mutation had been reported in 2 apparently unrelated families. Preliminary screening for mutations was performed with conformation-sensitive gel electrophoresis (CSGE), as described by Ganguly et al. (1993). Baldwin et al. (1995) cataloged 16 previously reported mutations and 5 chromosomal abnormalities affecting the 2q35 region that were associated with WS. Among 24 unrelated individuals with WS1 mutations, Farrer et al. (1994) found that no 2 had the same point mutation in the protein-coding region of PAX3 nor did any of them have a change in the same codon. In each of 2 families with WS type I, Wildhardt et al. (1996) described the causative PAX3 mutation. One mutation was an insertion in the paired box domain resulting in a protein termination within the paired box. The second mutation was a single-basepair substitution producing an arg271-to-cys amino acid change in the homeobox region. In the 'Splotch-delayed' mouse, mutation in the Pax3 paired domain (G9R) abrogates the DNA-binding activity of both the paired domain and the homeodomain, suggesting that they may functionally interact. To investigate this possibility further, Fortin et al. (1997) analyzed the DNA binding properties of additional point mutations in the PAX3 paired domain and homeodomain that occur in Waardenburg syndrome patients. Within the paired domain, 7 of 10 mutations were found to abrogate DNA binding by the paired domain. Remarkably, these 7 mutations also affected DNA binding by the homeodomain, causing either a complete loss, a reduction, or an increase in DNA-binding activity. In addition, the effect of paired domain mutations occurred at the level of monomer formation by the homeodomain, while the dimerization potential of this domain seemed unaffected in mutants where it could be analyzed. One mutation in the homeodomain also abrogated DNA binding by the paired domain. The observation that independent mutations in either domain can affect DNA binding by the other in the intact PAX3 protein strongly suggests that the 2 domains are not functionally independent but bind DNA through cooperative interactions. Tassabehji et al. (1995) reported the results of screening for mutations in the PAX3 and MITF genes in 134 families or individuals with auditory-pigmentary syndromes, such as Waardenburg syndrome or probable neural cristopathies. PAX3 mutations were found in 20 of 25 families with definite type I WS and 1 of 2 with type III WS, but in none of 23 with definite type II WS or 36 with other neural cristopathies. The latter category included 12 with Hirschsprung disease plus pigmentary disturbances or other problems and 1 with Yemenite deaf-blind-hypopigmentation syndrome (601706). They concluded that about 20% of cases of type II WS are caused by mutations in MITF. - PAX3/FKHR Fusion Gene A frequent finding in alveolar rhabdomyosarcomas is the translocation t(2;13)(q35;q14). Barr et al. (1993) determined that the PAX3 gene is affected by the t(2;13) translocation associated with alveolar rhabdomyosarcoma. The rearrangement breakpoints occurred within an intron downstream of the paired box and homeodomain-encoding regions. Galili et al. (1993) isolated the chromosome 13 gene that is fused with PAX3 and identified it as a member of the forkhead domain family, which encodes transcription factors containing a conserved DNA-binding motif related to the Drosophila region-specific homeotic gene 'forkhead.' They referred to the gene as FKHR (136533) for 'forkhead in rhabdomyosarcoma.' Thus, disruption of the PAX3 gene can cause either neoplasia or congenital malformation. Other genes that are implicated in both neoplasia and congenital anomalies include the oncogene GLI3 (165240), the oncogene RET (164761), and the tumor suppressor gene WT1 (607102). ANIMAL MODEL The work of Bosher and Hallpike (1966) on an animal analog, deaf white cats, suggested that destruction of the inner ear mechanism occurs in the first days of extrauterine life and was correlated with an inability to regulate properly the constitution of the endolymphatic fluid. The cat, like man, may escape deafness in one or both ears. If more of the factors that lead to retention of hearing were known, deafness might be preventable. Motohashi et al. (1994) pointed out that melanocytes are a normal component of the inner ear, including the stria vascularis. There are 3 known mutations in the mouse which lead to a deficiency of melanocytes in mast cells: white dominant spotting (W), Steel (Sl), and microphthalmia (mi). All 3 mutants have a thin stria vascularis, without melanocyte-like intermediate cells, and severe impairment of hearing. Thus, the absence of intermediate cells or melanocytes causes severe hearing loss. The absence of melanin has little influence on hearing acuity because albino mice without melanin have no impairment of hearing. Other genes in the 9q34 band have homologs on mouse chromosome 2. In the mouse, the 'lethal-spotted' (ls) mutation, which results not only in spotting but also in failure of the entire ganglia to colonize the gut, is located on chromosome 2. Jacobs-Cohen et al. (1987) found that in lethal spotting piebald (ls/ls) mice, who develop megacolon, the terminal 2 mm of intestine does not become colonized by neural crest cells, resulting in aganglionosis. Neural crest cells transplanted from areas around the neural tube (primary explants) or foregut (secondary explants) did not colonize the terminal portions of the hindgut. These findings suggested that the nonneuronal components are abnormal, preventing migration of normal neural crest derivatives into the bowel wall. Epstein et al. (1991) studied a deletion of mouse chromosome 1 that involved the 'splotch' locus. The murine equivalent of the ALPP gene was included in the deletion, thus supporting the notion that 'splotch' is the equivalent of WS1. Furthermore, Epstein et al. (1991) mapped the paired box gene Pax-3 to a region near or at the Sp locus on mouse chromosome 1 and found Pax-3 to be deleted in mice heterozygous for a splotch allele. In another allelic variant of splotch, they found deletion of 32 nucleotides in the Pax-3 mRNA transcript and gene. The deletion was located within the paired homeodomain of Pax-3 and was predicted to create a truncated protein as a result of a newly created termination codon at the deletion breakpoint. The splotch mutation is associated in the mouse with spina bifida and exencephaly. The findings were interpreted to indicate that Pax-3 plays a key role in normal neural development. Moase and Trasler (1992) reviewed the subject of the splotch locus in mouse mutants. Steel and Smith (1992) found that, unlike individuals with Waardenburg syndrome, the splotch mouse has normal hearing. They suggested that the difference in expression of the genes in the 2 species may result from different parts of the gene being mutated or from modifying influences as yet undefined. Epstein et al. (1993) demonstrated that in the original, spontaneously arising Sp allele, a complex mutation in the PAX3 gene had occurred, including an A-to-T transversion at the invariant 3-prime AG splice acceptor of intron 3. This mutation abrogated the normal splicing of intron 3, resulting in the generation of 4 aberrantly spliced mRNA transcripts. Two of the transcripts made use of cryptic 3-prime splice sites within the downstream exon, generating small deletions which disrupted the reading frame of the transcripts. A third aberrant splicing event resulted in the deletion of exon 4, while a fourth retained intron 3. None of these mutations would be expected to result in functional PAX3 proteins. Asher et al. (1996) stated that over 50 human PAX3 mutations leading to hearing, craniofacial, limb, and pigmentation anomalies had been identified. Variability in penetrance and expressivity is observed in humans with PAX3 mutations and in mice with 'splotch' mutations. In mice with certain 'splotch' mutations, influence of the genetic background and sex of the individual on penetrance and expressivity is demonstrable. Asher et al. (1996) described a murine model for Waardenburg syndrome variation and concluded that a minimum of 2 genes interact with the 'splotch' mutation to influence the craniofacial features of these mice. One of these genes may be either X-linked or sex-influenced, while the other is autosomal. They stated that these studies in mice may lead to the identification of genes that modify the expression of human PAX3 mutations. Fleming and Copp (2000) exploited variations in the normal pattern of cranial neural tube closure (closure 2) among inbred mouse strains. Strains with a more caudal location of cranial neural tube closure (e.g., DBA/2) were relatively resistant to neural tube defects (NTDs), whereas strains with a rostrally positioned closure 2 (e.g., NZW) exhibited increased susceptibility to NTDs. The authors back-crossed the 'splotch' (Sp2H) mutant gene onto both the DBA/2 and NZW backgrounds. After transfer to the DBA/2 background, the frequency of cranial NTDs was reduced significantly in Sp2H homozygotes, confirming a protective effect of caudal closure 2. In contrast, Sp2H homozygotes on the NZW background had a persistently high frequency of cranial NTDs. The frequency of spina bifida was not altered in either backcross, emphasizing the specificity of this genetic effect for cranial neurulation only. The authors concluded that variation in the pattern of cranial neural tube closure is a genetically determined factor influencing susceptibility to cranial NTDs. Lagutina et al. (2002) generated mice carrying a Pax3-Fkhr knockin allele. Despite low expression of this allele, heterozygous offspring of Pax3-Fkhr chimeric mice showed developmental abnormalities, including intraventricular septum defects, tricuspid valve insufficiency, and diaphragm defects, which caused congestive heart failure leading to perinatal death. Heterozygotes also displayed malformations of some but not all hypaxial muscles. However, neither newborn heterozygous pups nor their chimeric parents showed any signs of malignancy. Lagutina et al. (2002) concluded that the Pax2-Fkhr allele causes lethal developmental defects in knockin mice but is insufficient to cause muscle tumors. Relaix et al. (2003) found that mice expressing Pax3/Fkhr displayed developmental defects, including ectopic delamination and inappropriate migration of muscle precursor cells. These events resulted from overexpression of Met (164860), leading to constitutive activation of Met signaling. The gain-of-function phenotype was also characterized by overactivation of MyoD (159970).

comment: DESCRIPTION SOX family proteins are characterized by a unique DNA-binding domain, a high mobility group (HMG) box which shows at least 50% sequence similarity with SRY (480000), the sex-determining factor. Members of this family have been shown to be conserved during evolution and to play key roles during animal development (Osaki et al., 1999). For general information about SOX proteins, see 600898. CLONING Osaki et al. (1999) isolated SOX30 from both mouse and human testis cDNA libraries. RT-PCR of the human clone revealed 2 types of SOX30 mRNA, encoding deduced polypeptides of 753 and 501 amino acid residues, designated type I and type II, respectively. Type II appears to result from a frameshift due to exon skipping. The HMG box of SOX30 shows less than 50% similarity with other SOX proteins and no significant homology outside this area. Northern blot analysis of human tissues indicated a testis-restricted pattern of expression. Northern blot analysis of mouse tissues indicated Sox30 expression only in normal adult testis, although RT-PCR of embryonic mouse tissues indicated expression in kidney, brain, lung, heart, and stomach as well as in testis. The specific expression of Sox30 in normal testes, but not in maturing germ cell-deficient testes, suggested the involvement of Sox30 in differentiation of male germ cells. Western blot analysis indicated that SOX30 protein is exclusively localized in cell nuclei. GENE FUNCTION Osaki et al. (1999) found that in vitro translated Sox30 specifically binds an ACAAT sequence and shows a preference for guanine residues surrounding this core motif. Anti-Sox30 antibody was able to induce a supershift of the SOX30-ACAAT complex. The full-length type I Sox30 was capable of activating transcription in CV-1 transfected cells. MAPPING By fluorescence in situ hybridization, Osaki et al. (1999) mapped the human SOX30 gene to chromosome 5q33. By interspecific backcross analysis, they mapped the mouse Sox30 gene to the central region of chromosome 11, an area that shows syntenic homology with human 5q.

comment: DESCRIPTION OSBPL1A is a member of the OSBP family of intracellular lipid receptors. For background information on OSBPs, see OSBP2 (606729). CLONING By EST database searching for sequences homologous to OSBP (167040), followed by RT-PCR, Laitinen et al. (1999) identified 6 OSBP-related proteins, including OSBPL1A, which they called ORP1. Northern blot analysis revealed expression of a 3.6-kb ORP1 transcript in all tissues tested, with greatest abundance in brain, heart, skeletal muscle, and kidney. Endogenous expression in a neuroblastoma cell line was upregulated by exposure to low density lipoprotein. Similar treatment on a hepatocellular carcinoma cell line did not result in significant alterations in ORP1 mRNA levels. Xu et al. (2001) cloned ORP1 by database searching and multiple rounds of cDNA library screening. ORP1 encodes a deduced 437-amino acid protein. Yeast complementation assays indicated that ORP1 is a counterpart of yeast Kes1. Fluorescence microscopy demonstrated expression of ORP1 in the cytosol. Lehto et al. (2001) used RT-PCR analysis with specific primers to isolate a full-length cDNA encoding a long variant of ORP1. Sequence analysis predicted that the 950-amino acid protein contains a C-terminal sterol-binding (SB) domain of approximately 400 residues that includes the OSBP motif (EQVSHHPP). The N terminus contains 3 ankyrin-like repeats and a pleckstrin homology (PH) domain. This long variant is referred to as OSBPL1B, and its C terminus is nearly identical to the 437-amino acid variant, OSBPL1A, reported by Xu et al. (2001). OSBPL1B is most homologous to OSBPL2 (606731), with 85% identity in their SB domains. Jaworski et al. (2001) cloned multiple OSBPs, including OSBPL1A and OSBPL1B. They determined that the OSBPL1A protein does not have a PH domain. RT-PCR analysis detected ubiquitous expression of OSBPL1B, whereas expression of OSBPL1A was restricted to retina, brain, pineal gland, fetal brain, and cultured retinal pigment epithelial cells. GENE FUNCTION Binding analysis by Xu et al. (2001) showed strongest binding of ORP1 to phosphatidic acid, with weaker binding to cardiolipin and phosphatidylinositol 3-phosphate. GENE STRUCTURE By database analysis, Lehto et al. (2001) determined that the ORP1 gene contains 28 exons. Jaworski et al. (2001) determined that the OSBPL1A variant is encoded by 13 exons, while the OSBPL1B variant is encoded by 28 exons. MAPPING By sequence analysis, Lehto et al. (2001) mapped the OSBPL1A gene to chromosome 18. Jaworski et al. (2001) refined the localization to 18q11-q12.

comment: Glycogen synthase kinase 3-alpha (GSK3A; EC 2.7.1.37) is a multifunctional protein serine kinase, homologous to Drosophila 'shaggy' (zeste-white3) and implicated in the control of several regulatory proteins including glycogen synthase (see GYS1, 138570) and transcription factors (e.g., JUN, 165160). It also plays a role in the WNT (164820) and PI3K (see PIK3CG, 601232) signaling pathways (see review by Ali et al. (2001)). CLONING Woodgett (1990) cloned rat Gsk3a and Gsk3b (605004). The deduced 483-amino acid Gsk3a protein is 93% identical overall and 99% identical in the kinase catalytic domain to the human protein (GenBank GENBANK AAA62432). SDS-PAGE analysis showed expression of the 51-kD rat protein as predicted from the primary sequence. Northern blot analysis revealed wide expression of a 2.5-kb transcript in rat tissues. Western blot analysis, however, showed that expression is variable, suggesting differential modes of transcriptional and translational regulation. BIOCHEMICAL FEATURES Hughes et al. (1993) showed that under resting conditions GSK3A and its homologs are highly phosphorylated at tyr279 in the phosphorylation loop. Constitutive phosphorylation of this tyrosine is important for kinase activity. Dephosphorylation of tyr279 after mitogen activation is accompanied by kinase inactivation. Fang et al. (2000) found that PKA (see 188830) as well as PI3K-activated PKB (164730) inactivate GSK3A by phosphorylation at ser21. Yost et al. (1998) characterized the GSK3 binding activities of FRAT1 (602503) and FRAT2 (605006), which inhibit the phosphorylation of CTNNB1 (116806) and positively regulate the WNT signaling pathway. Fang et al. (2002) demonstrated that lysophosphatidic acid primarily utilizes a PKC (see 176960)-dependent pathway to modulate GSK3 and that certain growth factors (e.g., PDGFB, 190040), which control GSK3 mainly through PIK3-PKB, are able to regulate GSK3 through an alternative, redundant phospholipase-C-gamma (see 600220)-PKC pathway. GENE FUNCTION Alzheimer disease (AD; 104300) is associated with increased production and aggregation of amyloid-beta-40 and -42 peptides into plaques. Phiel et al. (2003) showed that GSK3A is required for maximal production of the beta-amyloid-40 and -42 peptides generated from the amyloid precursor protein (APP; 104760) by presenilin (PSEN1; 104311)-dependent gamma-secretase cleavage. In vitro, lithium, a GSK3A inhibitor, blocked the production of the beta-amyloid peptides by interfering with the gamma-secretase step. In mice expressing familial AD-associated mutations in APP and PSEN1, lithium reduced the levels of beta-amyloid peptides. Phiel et al. (2003) noted that GSK3A also phosphorylates the tau protein (MAPT; 157140), the principal component of neurofibrillary tangles in AD, and suggested that inhibition of GSK3A may offer a new therapeutic approach to AD. ANIMAL MODEL By expressing GSK3A and GSK3B and kinase-dead mutants, generated by altering 2 consecutive lysine residues, in frog eggs, He et al. (1995) showed that the dominant-negative mutants induced dorsal differentiation whereas the wildtype forms caused ventral differentiation. The authors suggested that dorsal differentiation involves the suppression of GSK3 activity by a Wnt-related signal. Jia et al. (2002) reported that in addition to the role of Gsk3 proteins as inhibitory components of the Wnt pathway, they also inhibit the 'hedgehog' (Hh) pathway (see SHH, 600725) in Drosophila. Gsk3 phosphorylates 'cubitus interruptus' (Ci; see GLI3, 165240) after a primed phosphorylation by PKA, causing hyperphosphorylation of Ci and thus targeting it for proteolytic processing. In contrast, Hh opposes Ci proteolysis by promoting its dephosphorylation. Trowbridge et al. (2006) showed that hematopoietic repopulation by hematopoietic stem cells (HSC) can be augmented by administration of a GSK3 inhibitor to recipient mice transplanted with mouse or human HSCs. The results suggested that the use of GSK3 inhibitors may provide a potent and unique clinical approach to directly enhance HSC repopulation in vivo. MOLECULAR GENETICS By RT-PCR and SSCP analysis, Hansen et al. (1997) detected only silent polymorphisms in the 2 GSK3 isoforms in diabetes mellitus type II (NIDDM; 125853) patients and their first-degree relatives. Based on this finding and mapping data, the authors concluded that GSK3 is unlikely to be involved in the pathogenesis of NIDDM. MAPPING Using somatic cell hybrid and FISH analysis, Hansen et al. (1997) mapped the GSK3A gene to chromosome 19q13.1-q13.2, a locus distinct from that for GSK3B at 3q13.3-q21.

comment: DESCRIPTION SUFU encodes a component of the sonic hedgehog (SHH; 600725)/patched (PTCH; 601309) signaling pathway. Mutations in genes encoding components of this pathway are deleterious for normal development and are associated with cancer-predisposing syndromes (e.g., HPE3, 142945; BCNS, 109400; and GCPS, 175700). CLONING By EST database searching for homologs of Drosophila suppressor of fused (Sufu), followed by RACE, Kogerman et al. (1999) obtained a cDNA encoding human SUFU. The deduced 484-amino acid protein is 40% identical to the fly protein. Northern blot analysis detected ubiquitous expression of a minor 2.8-kb and a major 5.5-kb transcript. Whole-mount in situ hybridization analysis detected expression throughout mid gestation in the neural tube and, later, in the neural tube's brain and spinal cord derivatives, overlapping with the expression of Ptch and Gli1-3 (see GLI3, 165240). Similar analysis in a 12-week human embryo showed marked expression in perichondrial osteoblasts, cells that also receive a hedgehog signal. Luciferase reporter analysis indicated that SUFU inhibits the transcriptional activity of GLI1 (165220) and the response to SHH signaling. Immunoprecipitation analysis determined that SUFU and GLI1 are associated in an intracellular complex. Confocal microscopy demonstrated both cytoplasmic and nuclear expression. However, colocalization with GLI1, due to a central leucine-rich CRM1 (XPO1; 602559)-dependent nuclear-export signal, is restricted to the cytoplasm. Inhibition of CRM1 results in nuclear expression of GLI1 in the absence of full-length SUFU, with an intact C terminus necessary for GLI1-induced transcriptional activation. Truncated GLI1 bound to DNA also interacts with SUFU. Stone et al. (1999) independently cloned and characterized SUFU and identified shorter splice variants, truncated by 52 and 3 amino acids. The full-length protein, which is 97% identical to the mouse protein, contains a PEST sequence and multiple potential phosphorylation sites. In addition to the same transcripts identified by Kogerman et al. (1999), they detected smaller 2.0- and 1.0-kb transcripts in testis. By semiquantitative PCR, they determined that the full-length isoform is more abundant in all tissues. GST pull-down and yeast 2-hybrid analysis demonstrated that SUFU interacts with GLI2 (165230) and GLI3 through its extreme C-terminal end, as well as with GLI1 and SLIMB (BTRC; 603482). Reporter analysis indicated that BTRC containing an F-box domain potentiates the inhibitory effect of SUFU on GLI activity. Stone et al. (1999) concluded that SUFU is a direct negative regulator of GLI and that this regulation may occur at multiple levels, possibly depending on the relative intracellular concentrations of different signaling components. Grimm et al. (2001) identified a low abundance isoform, SUFU-XL, of 485 amino acids as well as shorter isoforms restricted to leukocytes and testis. They detected expression of normal SUFU and SUFU-XL in a panel of tumor cDNA libraries. Immunoprecipitation analysis showed that neither of the shorter isoforms is able to bind GLI1. GENE STRUCTURE By genomic sequence analysis, Grimm et al. (2001) determined that the mouse and human SUFU genes contain 12 exons. MAPPING By FISH, Stone et al. (1999) mapped the SUFU gene to chromosome 10q24-q25. Grimm et al. (2001) confirmed the localization by radiation hybrid analysis. By FISH, Taylor et al. (2002) mapped the SUFU gene to 10q24.3 distal to the PTEN gene (601728), which maps to 10q23.31 and is approximately 1 Mb telomeric to BTRC. MOLECULAR GENETICS Grimm et al. (2001) found no mutations in the SUFU gene in patients with split-hand/split-foot malformation type 3 (600095). Bayani et al. (2000) showed that loss of heterozygosity (LOH) on 10q24 is frequent in medulloblastomas, suggesting that this region contains 1 or more tumor suppressor genes. Taylor et al. (2002) reported children with medulloblastoma who carried germline and somatic mutations in SUFU in the SHH pathway, accompanied by LOH of the wildtype allele. Several of these mutations encoded truncated proteins that are unable to export the GLI transcription factor (165220) from nucleus to cytoplasm, resulting in the activation of SHH signaling. Thus, SUFU is a tumor suppressor gene that predisposes individuals to medulloblastoma by modulating the SHH signaling pathway through a newly identified mechanism. Taylor et al. (2002) noted that all 4 medulloblastomas with SUFU truncating mutations were of the desmoplastic subtype. Desmoplastic tumors make up about 20 to 30% of medulloblastomas, have a more nodular architecture than 'classical' medulloblastoma, and may have a better prognosis. Activation of the SHH pathway is particularly high in desmoplastic medulloblastomas, as shown by increased expression of the SHH target genes GLI, SMOH (601500), and PTCH (601309).

comment: DESCRIPTION The SOX gene family encodes a group of transcription factors defined by the conserved high mobility group (HMG) DNA-binding domain. Unlike most transcription factors, SOX transcription factors bind to the minor groove of DNA, causing a 70- to 85-degree bend and introducing local conformational changes. CLONING Using homology with the mouse Sox6 gene, Cohen-Barak et al. (2001) identified a human EST containing a partial sequence of SOX6. They used this clone to screen a myoblast cDNA library and obtained 2 splice variants encoding SOX6. The longer variant encodes a deduced 808-amino acid protein containing a leucine zipper motif, 2 Q-boxes (glutamine-rich domains), and a C-terminal SRY (480000)-related HMG domain. There are 2 polyalanine stretches of 6 and 5 residues between the Q boxes. The mouse and human SOX6 proteins share 94.3% identity overall, with 100% identity in the functionally critical regions. The leucine zipper and the N-terminal Q-box can form a long coiled-coil domain, and this region shares 91% identity with the corresponding region of the long form of SOX5 (604975). Northern blot analysis detected a 3-kb transcript that was expressed predominantly in testis and an 8- to 9-kb transcript that was most abundant in skeletal muscle, although it was expressed in other tissues at varied levels. Connor et al. (1995) found that mouse Sox6 is highly expressed in adult mouse testis and in the developing embryonic nervous system. GENE FUNCTION Connor et al. (1995) determined that the HMG domains of mouse Sox5 and Sox6 bind to the sequence 5-prime-AACAAT-3-prime. Lefebvre et al. (1998) reported that a long form of Sox5 (L-Sox5), Sox6, and Sox9 (608160) are coexpressed during mouse chondrogenesis. They identified a coiled-coil domain located in L-Sox5 and Sox6 that mediates protein dimerization and efficient binding to adjacent HMG DNA sites. In cotransfection experiments, Lefebvre et al. (1998) observed that L-Sox5, Sox6, and Sox9 cooperatively activated expression of Col2a1 (120140), a chondrocyte differentiation marker. Using gene targeting, Smits et al. (2001) generated null mutations of the Sox5 and Sox6 genes in mice to investigate the genes' role in cartilage formation. They observed that both Sox5 and Sox6 single gene null mutations were early lethal and that the mice had mild skeletal abnormalities that affected the size and mineralization rate of a small, distinct subset of endochondral elements. The sternum of Sox6 deficient mice was abnormal. Most died at birth, failing to breathe. In contrast to the single gene null mice, the Sox5/Sox6 double null embryos died in utero with a severe, generalized chondrodysplasia. Using detailed histology and gene expression analysis, Smits et al. (2001) concluded that L-Sox5 and Sox6 are redundant enhancers of chondroblast functions, controlling both expression of extracellular matrix genes and cell proliferation. GENE STRUCTURE Cohen-Barak et al. (2001) determined that the SOX6 gene contains 16 exons. MAPPING By FISH, Cohen-Barak et al. (2001) mapped the SOX6 gene to chromosome 11p15.3-p15.2, a region that shows homology of synteny to the distal portion of mouse chromosome 7 where Connor et al. (1995) mapped the mouse Sox6 gene. ANIMAL MODEL Hagiwara et al. (2000) characterized a radiation-induced mutant allele of the mouse 'pink-eyed dilution' (p) locus (203200) that was associated with failure-to-thrive syndrome and diminished pigmentation. Homozygous mice showed delayed growth and died within 2 weeks of birth. They developed progressive atrioventricular heart block and significant ultrastructural changes in both cardiac and skeletal muscle cells. Hagiwara et al. (2000) determined that the mutation was associated with a chromosome 7 inversion that disrupted both the p gene and the Sox6 gene.

comment: CLONING The 'dispatched' (disp) gene is required for long-range hedgehog signaling in Drosophila. By screening mouse cDNA libraries using ESTs identified in database searches, Ma et al. (2002) isolated cDNAs encoding 2 murine homologs of dipatched, which they called Dispa and Dispb (607503). They predicted that the dispatched proteins all have 12 transmembrane spans with cytoplasmic N and C termini. GENE FUNCTION Ma et al. (2002) showed that murine Dispa could rescue dispatched function in Drosophila and was essential for all hedgehog patterning activities examined in the early mouse embryo. Embryonic fibroblasts lacking Dispa responded normally to exogenously provided Sonic hedgehog (SHH; 600725) signal but were impaired in stimulation of other responding cells when expressing Shh. Ma et al. (2002) developed a biochemical assay that directly measured the activity of Disp proteins in release of soluble hedgehog proteins. This activity was disrupted by alteration of residues functionally conserved in patched (PTCH; 601309) and in a related family of bacterial transmembrane transporters, suggesting similar mechanisms of action for all of these proteins. MAPPING The International Radiation Hybrid Mapping Consortium mapped the DISPA gene to chromosome 1 (TMAP RH98328). Ma et al. (2002) stated that the human DISPA gene maps to chromosome 1q42.

comment: A number sign (#) is used with this entry because the hypotrichosis-lymphedema-telangiectasia syndrome is caused by mutation in the transcription factor gene SOX18 (601618). CLINICAL FEATURES Irrthum et al. (2003) described 3 families with an unusual association of hypotrichosis, lymphedema, and telangiectasia. In the first family, previously reported by Devriendt et al. (2002), a boy and girl, offspring of first-cousin Belgian parents, were affected. The boy was born at 32 weeks' gestation and presented with respiratory distress. A normal amount of scalp hair was present at birth but decreased progressively to the extent of total alopecia at age 6 months. The hair remained very sparse with absent eyebrows and eyelashes; sweating, nails, and teeth were normal. The skin over the hands and feet was thin and transparent, with visible blood vessels. Bilateral hydrocele was surgically corrected at age 12 years. Beginning at approximately 15 years of age, the patient progressively developed lymphedema of the legs. At 25 years of age, a doppler ultrasonogram of the venous system of the legs was normal. At that time, however, lymphatic scintigraphy with radiolabeled tracer showed no evidence of lymphatic flow from the dorsum of the foot. His younger sister presented with a similar phenotype. At birth she had normal black hair. A vascular nevus was present on the palm of the right hand and faded during childhood. During infancy, her hair diminished progressively, and from approximately 2 years of age her hair was very sparse with no eyebrows or eyelashes, and she did not develop axillary or pubic hair at puberty. Around puberty, she developed progressive lymphedema of the legs. At age 26 years she showed normal teeth, nails, and sweating, but her skin was thin. The skin over her hands and feet was transparent, and dilated veins and varicosities were apparent on the palm of her right hand. The single affected individual in the second family studied by Irrthum et al. (2003) was a 12-year-old girl, the offspring of unaffected first-cousin Turkish parents, who had previously been described in detail by Glade et al. (2001). Lymphedema of the legs appeared at age 4 years. Scalp hair had always been sparse; eyebrows and eyelashes were missing. Palms and soles showed multiple telangiectasias, with ectatic capillaries and cutis marmorata-like lividity of the skin. The index patient in the third family described by Irrthum et al. (2003), whose parents were normal and nonconsanguineous, had sparse hair at birth and presented with swelling of the upper eyelids, scrotal edema, and very large bilateral hydroceles. Hair loss began at approximately 6 months of age, accompanied by a lightening of its color. At 6 years of age, alopecia was almost complete, including eyebrows and eyelashes. The patient presented mild eczema on the cheeks and telangiectasias on the scalp, scrotum, and legs. His nails and teeth were normal. His brother died in utero at 30 weeks' gestation. The fetus had nonimmune hydrops fetalis, with chylous effusions in the pleural and peritoneal cavities. The lungs presented generalized vascular congestion and a mild dilatation of lymphatic vessels. MOLECULAR GENETICS In each of the 3 HLTS families they described, Irrthum et al. (2003) identified a mutation in the SOX18 gene. In the first and second families, both consanguineous, they identified homozygosity for the mutations ala104 to pro (A104P; 601618.0001) and trp95 to arg (W95R; 601618.0002), respectively. In the third family, which was nonconsanguineous, they identified a heterozygous cys240-to-ter mutation (C240X; 601618.0003) in the 2 affected brothers, which indicated that they had a dominant form of HLTS, apparently inherited from a parent who had the disorder in probable gonadal mosaicism.

comment: CLONING Foster et al. (1994) constructed a high-resolution map across a 20-Mb region spanning chromosome 17q24.1-q25.1 that was identified by Tommerup et al. (1993) as containing the locus for campomelic dysplasia (CMPD; 114290). Using this map and a translocation chromosome breakpoint from a sex-reversed patient with campomelic dysplasia (see 114290) previously reported by Young et al. (1992), Foster et al. (1994) identified an SRY (480000)-related gene, SOX9, located 88 kb distal to the translocation breakpoint. The gene is predicted to encode a 509-amino acid polypeptide containing an SRY homology domain. The isolated cDNA corresponded to 3.9 kb of the transcript, but Northern blot analysis detected a 4.5-kb transcript in adult testes, adult heart, and fetal brain. The SOX9 protein HMG box domain at amino acids 104-182 showed 71% similarity with the SRY HMG box, and the C-terminal third of the protein has a proline- and glutamine-rich region similar to activation domains present in some transcription factors. The genomic arrangement of SOX9 is such that the 5-prime end is oriented toward the centromere of chromosome 17 and closest to the breakpoint. It is possible that 1 or more exons are present 5-prime to the known exons and that these are disrupted by the translocation. Using a fragment derived from mouse SOX9, Wagner et al. (1994) isolated human SOX9 from a human fetal cDNA brain library. The cDNA was found to encode a 509-amino acid protein with a predicted molecular mass of 56 kD. GENE FUNCTION Morais da Silva et al. (1996) found that, consistent with its role in sex determination, SOX9 expression closely follows differentiation of Sertoli cells in the mouse testis, in experimental sex reversal when fetal ovaries are grafted to adult kidneys, and in the chick where there is no evidence for an Sry gene. The results suggested to the authors that SOX9 plays an essential role in sex determination, possibly immediately downstream of SRY in mammals, and that it functions as a critical Sertoli cell differentiation factor, perhaps in all vertebrates. By cell transfection experiments, Sudbeck et al. (1996) showed that SOX9 can transactivate transcription from a reporter plasmid through the motif AACAAAG, a sequence recognized by other HMG domain transcription factors. By fusing all or part of SOX9 to the DNA-binding domain of yeast GAL4, the transactivating function was mapped to a transcription activation domain at the C terminus of SOX9. With 1 exception, all SOX9 nonsense and frameshift mutations in patients with campomelic dysplasia and sex reversal lead to truncation of this domain, suggesting to Sudbeck et al. (1996) that impairment of gonadal and skeletal development in these cases results, at least in part, from loss of the transactivation of genes downstream of SOX9. During chondrogenesis in the mouse, Sox9 is coexpressed with Col2a1 (120140), the gene encoding type II collagen, the major cartilage matrix protein. COL2A1 is therefore a candidate regulatory target of SOX9. Regulatory sequences required for chondrocyte-specific expression of the COL2A1 gene have been localized to conserved sequences in the first intron in rats, mice, and humans. Bell et al. (1997) showed that SOX9 protein binds specifically to sequences in the first intron of human COL2A1. Mutation of these sequences abolished SOX9 binding and chondrocyte-specific expression of a COL2A1-driven reporter gene (COL2A1-lacZ) in transgenic mice. Furthermore, ectopic expression of Sox9 transactivated both a COL2A1-driven reporter gene and the endogenous Col2a1 gene in transgenic mice. These results demonstrated that COL2A1 expression is directly regulated by SOX9 protein in vivo and implicated abnormal regulation of COL2A1 during chondrogenesis as a cause of the skeletal abnormalities associated with campomelic dysplasia. SOX9 is expressed during chondrocyte differentiation and is upregulated in male and downregulated in female genital ridges during sex differentiation. To study the sex- and tissue-specific regulation of SOX9, Kanai and Koopman (1999) defined the transcription start site and characterized the Sox9 promoter region in the mouse. The Sox9 proximal promoter shows moderately high nucleotide similarity between mouse and human. Transient transfection experiments using various deletion constructs at the 6.8-kb upstream region of the mouse Sox9 gene fused to a luciferase reporter showed that the interval between 193 and 73 bp from the transcription start site was essential for maximal promoter activity in cell lines and in primary male and female gonadal somatic cells and liver cells isolated from mouse embryos 13.5 days postcoitum. This minimal promoter region was shown by DNase I hypersensitive site assay to be in an 'open' state of chromatin structure in gonads of both sexes, but not in the liver. Promoter activity was higher in testis than in ovary and liver, but deletion of the region from -193 to -73 bp abolished this difference. Kanai and Koopman (1999) concluded that the proximal promoter region is in part responsible for the sex- and tissue-specific expression of the SOX9 gene, and that more distal positive and negative elements contribute to its regulation in vivo, consistent with the observation that translocations upstream from the SOX9 gene can result in campomelic dysplasia. Murakami et al. (2000) showed that expression of Sox9 is upregulated by fibroblast growth factors (FGFs; see 601513) in primary chondrocytes and in Sox9-expressing mesenchymal cells. They further presented evidence that FGF stimulation of Sox9 expression is mediated by the mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) cascade (see 176948), a signal transduction pathway that is activated by growth factors such as FGF. The data strongly suggested that FGF and the MAPK pathway play an important role in the regulation of Sox9 expression during chondrocyte differentiation. In most mammals, male development is triggered by the transient expression of the SRY gene (480000) on the Y chromosome, which initiates a cascade of gene interactions ultimately leading to the formation of a testis from the indifferent fetal gonad. Several genes, in particular SOX9, have a crucial role in this pathway. Bishop et al. (2000) described a dominant insertion mutation, Odsex (Ods), in which XX mice carrying a 150-kb deletion approximately 1 Mb upstream of Sox9 developed as sterile XX males lacking Sry. During embryogenesis, wildtype XX fetal gonads downregulated Sox9 expression, whereas XY and XX Ods/+ fetal gonads upregulated and maintained its expression. Bishop et al. (2000) proposed that the Ods mutation removed a long-range, gonad-specific regulatory element that mediates the repression of Sox9 expression in XX fetal gonads. This repression would normally be antagonized by Sry protein in XY embryos. The data were considered consistent with Sox9 being a direct downstream target of Sry and provided genetic evidence to support a general repressor model of sex determination in mammals. The Ods mouse phenotype, described by Bishop et al. (2000), consists of female-to-male sex reversal in XX Ods/+ mice and a characteristic eye phenotype of microphthalmia with cataracts. The mutation arose in a transgenic line of mice carrying a tyrosinase (TYR; 606933) minigene driven by the dopachrome tautomerase (DCT; 191275) promoter region. The minigene integrated 1 Mb upstream of Sox9 and was accompanied by a deletion of 134 kb. Ods causes sex reversal in the absence of Sry by upregulating Sox9 expression and maintaining a male pattern of Sox9 expression in XX Ods/+ embryonic gonads. Qin et al. (2004) reported that the 134-kb deletion alone was insufficient to cause sex reversal. Rather, the Dct promoter was capable of acting over a distance of 1 Mb to induce inappropriate expression of Sox9 in the retinal pigmented epithelium of the eye, causing the observed microphthalmia. In addition, it induced Sox9 expression in the melanocytes where it caused pigmentation defects. The authors proposed that Ods sex reversal may be due to the Dct promoter element interacting with gonad-specific enhancer elements to produce the observed male pattern expression of Sox9 in the embryonic gonads. Huang et al. (2001) showed that the chondrogenic transcription factor SOX9 is a target of signaling by the parathyroid hormone-related peptide (PTHRP; 168470) in the growth plate of endochondral bones. PTHRP strongly increased the phosphorylation of SOX9 and increased the SOX9-dependent activity of chondrocyte-specific enhancers in the gene for type II collagen (COL2A1) in transient transfection experiments. This increased enhancer activity did not occur with a SOX9 mutant harboring serine-to-alanine substitutions in its 2 consensus protein kinase A phosphorylation sites. Since SOX9 is a target of PTHRP signaling in prehypertrophic chondrocytes in the growth plate, Huang et al. (2001) hypothesized that SOX9 mediates at least some effects of PTHRP in the growth plate and that the PTHRP-dependent increased transcriptional activity of SOX9 helps maintain the chondrocyte phenotype of cells in the prehypertrophic zone and inhibits their maturation to hypertrophic chondrocytes. In mammals, male sex determination starts when the Y chromosome Sry gene is expressed within the undetermined male gonad. One of the earliest effects of SRY expression is to induce upregulation of SOX9 gene expression in the developing gonad. SOX9, like SRY, contains a high mobility group domain and is sufficient to induce testis differentiation in transgenic XX mice. Before sexual differentiation, SOX9 protein is initially found in the cytoplasm of undifferentiated gonads from both sexes. At the time of testis differentiation and anti-Mullerian hormone expression, it becomes localized to the nuclear compartment in males, whereas it is downregulated in females. Gasca et al. (2002) used NIH 3T3 cells as a model to examine the regulation of SOX9 nucleocytoplasmic shuttling. SOX9-transfected cells expressed nuclear and cytoplasmic SOX9, whereas transfected cells treated with the nuclear export inhibitor leptomycin B displayed an exclusive nuclear localization of SOX9. By using SOX9 deletion constructs in GFP fusion proteins, Gasca et al. (2002) identified a functional nuclear export signal sequence between amino acids 134 and 147 of the SOX9 high mobility group box. More strikingly, they showed that inhibiting nuclear export with leptomycin B in mouse XX gonads cultured in vitro induced a sex reversal phenotype characterized by nuclear SOX9 and anti-Mullerian hormone expression. These results indicated that the SOX9 nuclear export signal is essential for SOX9 sex-specific subcellular localization and could be part of a regulatory switch that represses (in females) or triggers (in males) male-specific sexual differentiation. By analyzing embryonic Sox9-null mice and using gain-of-function experiments, Cheung et al. (2005) determined that specification of trunk neural crest cells involves the coordinated activity of Sox9, Foxd3, and Slug (SNAI2; 602150). Each transcription factor appeared to regulate the acquisition of distinct neural crest cell properties, while the combined expression of Sox9, Slug, and Foxd3 induced cells to manifest all the principal transcriptional and morphologic characteristics of neural crest cells. By expression of Sox9 or Sox10 (602229) in early Xenopus embryos, Taylor and LaBonne (2005) found that each factor could direct the formation of neural crest precursors and the development of a range of neural crest derivatives. They detected no differences in the activities of Sox9 and Sox10 in these assays. They identified Sumo1 (601912) and Ubc9 (UBE2I; 601661) as Sox-interacting proteins that play a role in regulating the function of Sox9 and Sox10 during neural crest and inner ear development. - Effects of Chromosomal Translocations on SOX9 Many patients with campomelic dysplasia have chromosomal translocations involving regions surrounding or including the SOX9 gene. Wagner et al. (1994) found that the 17q breakpoints in 3 campomelic dysplasia patients with translocations mapped 50 kb or more from the SOX9 gene. Wirth et al. (1996) showed that the breakpoints in 2 affected patients reported by Wagner et al. (1994) were more than 130 kb 5-prime of SOX9, as was the breakpoint in a third patient with CMPD and a de novo t(6;17) translocation. The last patient was a phenotypic female with XY sex chromosome constitution, as were the 3 previously described CMPD translocation cases. Wirth et al. (1996) reviewed the mechanisms by which translocation breakpoints upstream from the SOX9 gene can result in defective expression during embryonic development. In their study, Wirth et al. (1996) investigated whether there was any difference in the expression of SOX9 alleles on the normal versus the translocation chromosome. No significant difference was found in the study of a lymphoblastoid cell line; however, they pointed out that this may not accurately reflect the situation of regulated expression of SOX9 during embryonic development. It had not been possible to analyze SOX9 expression in embryonic tissue from CMPD translocation cases. In a note added in proof, they referred to 3 additional de novo translocation or inversion cases involving the distal 17q in patients with CMPD. Because chromosomal breakpoints map 50 kb or more from the SOX9 gene and CMPD may be a contiguous gene syndrome (Schmickel, 1986), Ninomiya et al. (1996) cloned the breakpoint in the patient in search of a second gene associated with this syndrome. They isolated a cDNA adjacent to the breakpoint. Specific expression of this gene in testis suggested its candidacy for some role in CMPD and/or sex reversal. The mRNA, approximately 3.7 kb long, was expressed in testis as demonstrated by Northern blot analysis. However, they were unable to find any long open reading frame (ORF) in the 3.5-kb cDNA sequence or to detect any peptide following an in vitro translation experiment using RNA transcribed from this cDNA. Consequently, they speculated that the gene may play a critical role in differentiation or sex determination as a functional RNA. Whereas mutations in the ORF of SOX9 cause haploinsufficiency and campomelic dysplasia, the effects of translocations 5-prime to SOX9 were unclear and prompted Wunderle et al. (1998) to test whether these rearrangements also cause haploinsufficiency by altering spatial and temporal expression of SOX9. For this purpose, they generated mice transgenic for human SOX9-lacZ YACs containing variable amounts of DNA sequences upstream of SOX9. They showed that elements necessary for SOX9 expression during skeletal development are highly conserved between mouse and human and that a rearrangement upstream of SOX9, similar to those observed in campomelic dysplasia patients, leads to a substantial reduction of SOX9 expression, particularly in chondrogenic tissues. Thus, important regulatory elements are scattered over a large region upstream of SOX9 and explain how particular aspects of the CD phenotype are caused by chromosomal rearrangements 5-prime to SOX9. As noted earlier, several campomelic dysplasia translocation and inversion cases have been described with breakpoints outside the coding region, mapping to locations more than 130 kb proximal to SOX9. These cases are generally less severely affected than cases with SOX9 coding region mutations, as borne out by 3 new translocation cases presented by Pfeifer et al. (1999). They cloned the region extending 1.2 Mb upstream of the SOX9 gene in overlapping BAC and PAC clones and established a restriction map with rare-cutter enzymes. With STS-content mapping in somatic cell hybrids, as well as with FISH, they mapped precisely the breakpoints of 3 new and 3 previously described CMPD cases. The 6 CMPD breakpoints mapped to an interval 140 to 950 kb proximal to the SOX9 gene. With exon trapping, they isolated 5 potential exons from a YAC that spanned the region, 4 of which could be placed in the contig in the vicinity of the breakpoints. These potential exons showed the same transcriptional orientation, but only 2 had an ORF. Pfeifer et al. (1999) failed to detect expression of these fragments in several human and mouse cDNA libraries, as well as on Northern blots. Genomic sequence totaling 1,063 kb from the SOX9 5-prime flanking region was determined and analyzed, but no genes or transcripts could be identified. Together, these data suggested that chromosomal rearrangements most likely removed one or more cis-regulatory elements from the extended SOX9 control region. By yeast 2-hybrid analysis of a human embryo cDNA expression library, Zhou et al. (2002) found that the transcription activation domain of SOX9 interacted with the proline-, glutamine-, and leucine-rich (PQL) domain of TRAP230 (MED12; 300188), a component of the thyroid hormone receptor-associated protein (TRAP) complex. In vitro and in vivo assays confirmed that the proteins interact endogenously and associate with several other TRAP complex proteins in HeLa cell nuclear lysates. SOX9 and TRAP230 colocalized in nuclei of cultured human embryo chondrocytes. The isolated PQL domain of TRAP230 acted as a dominant-negative inhibitor of SOX9 activity. Komeda miniature rat Ishikawa (KMI) is a naturally occurring rat mutant that grows normally until 3 to 4 weeks of age, but then gradually develop longitudinal growth retardation without other organ abnormalities. Chikuda et al. (2004) found that expression of Sox9, which is normally downregulated in postmitotic chondrocytes, persisted in the nuclei of KMI growth plate chondrocytes. They determined that KMI rats have a deletion in the cGKII gene (PRKG2; 601591) that results in a truncated protein lacking the kinase domain. Transfection experiments in human cells revealed that cGKII phosphorylates SOX9 on ser181 and attenuates SOX9 function by inhibiting its nuclear entry. Furthermore, the impaired differentiation of cultured KMI chondrocytes was restored by silencing Sox9 by RNA interference. Chikuda et al. (2004) concluded that cGKII is a molecular switch that couples the cessation of proliferation and the start of hypertrophic chondrocyte differentiation through attenuating SOX9 function. Blache et al. (2004) found that Sox9 was expressed in fetal mouse intestinal epithelium. Expression of Sox9 was dependent on activity of the Wnt (see 164820) pathway. Sox9 repressed the expression of Cdx2 (600297) and Muc2 (158370), genes associated with intestinal epithelium differentiation. Blache et al. (2004) suggested that SOX9 may contribute to Wnt-dependent maintenance of a progenitor cell phenotype. MAPPING By fluorescence in situ hydridization, Foster et al. (1994) localized the human SOX9 gene to chromosome 17q24. Wagner et al. (1994) cited evidence that the murine SOX9 gene is on chromosome 11. MOLECULAR GENETICS In 6 of 9 patients with campomelic dysplasia (114290), Foster et al. (1994) identified mutations in single alleles of the SOX9 gene. The 3 mutations described in detail would be expected to destroy gene function; 2 caused frameshifts that led to premature chain termination and loss of one-third of the protein (608160.0002, 608160.0003), and 1 caused a premature termination that truncated the protein at 40% of its predicted length (608160.0001). Both parents of 2 of the patients did not have the mutation. The de novo appearance of a mutation in a sex-reversed campomelic patient established that alterations in SOX9 caused both abnormalities. The findings indicated that SOX9 is involved in both bone formation and control of testis development. Foster et al. (1994) suggested that campomelic dysplasia is an autosomal dominant disorder, as they did not detect mutations in both SOX9 alleles of any patient. Dominance appeared to be due to haploinsufficiency rather than gain of function. Wagner et al. (1994) likewise identified inactivating mutations in 1 SOX9 allele in nontranslocation CMPD-SOX9 cases pointing to haploinsufficiency for SOX9 as the cause of both campomelic dysplasia and autosomal XY sex reversal (see 608160.0005). The 17q breakpoints in 3 translocation cases mapped 50 kb or more from SOX9. Velagaleti et al. (2005) presented a balanced translocation, t(4;17)(q28.3;q24.3), segregating in a family with mild CMPD with Pierre Robin sequence (602196). They identified both chromosome breakpoints by FISH and sequenced them using a somatic cell hybrid. They found that the 17q24.3 breakpoint mapped approximately 900 kb upstream of SOX9, which was within the same BAC clone as the breakpoints of 2 other reported patients with mild CMPD. They also reported a prenatal identification of CMPD with male-to-female sex reversal in a fetus with a de novo balanced complex karyotype. The 17q breakpoint mapped approximately 1.3 Mb downstream of SOX9, making this the longest-range position effect found to that time in the field of human genetics and the first report of a patient with CMPD with the chromosome breakpoint mapping 3-prime of SOX9. By using the Regulatory Potential score in conjunction with analysis of the rearrangement breakpoints, they identified a candidate upstream cis-regulatory element, SOX9cre1 (SOX9 conserved regulatory element-1). Velagaleti et al. (2005) provided evidence that this 1.1-kb evolutionarily conserved element and the downstream breakpoint region colocalize with SOX9 in the interphase nucleus, despite being located 1.1 Mb upstream and 1.3 Mb downstream of it, respectively. Sock et al. (2003) presented 2 CMPD patients with de novo mutations in a conserved region preceding the HMG domain of SOX9. A long-term survivor with the acampomelic form of CMPD had an ala76-to-glu amino acid substitution (608160.0009), while a severely affected CMPD patient had an in-frame deletion of amino acid residues 66 through 75 (608160.0010). The conserved domain functions in the related transcription factor SOX10 as a DNA-dependent dimerization domain. The authors demonstrated that like SOX10, SOX9 binds cooperatively as a dimer to response elements in regulatory regions of some target genes such as the cartilage genes COL11A2 (120290) and cartilage-derived retinoic acid-sensitive protein (MIA/CDRAP; 601340). Dimerization and the resulting capacity to activate promoters via dimeric binding sites was lost in both mutant SOX9 proteins while other features involved in SOX9 function remained unaltered. The authors concluded that the dimerization domain is a third domain essential for SOX9 function during chondrogenesis. Hill-Harfe et al. (2005) presented fine mapping of chromosome 17 translocation breakpoints upstream of SOX9 associated with skeletal dysplasias. The breakpoint in this case was the most proximal to the SOX9 gene identified up to that time. Their family F had been reported by Stalker and Zori (1997) and Stalker et al. (2005); see Pierre Robin sequence with pectus excavatum and rib and scapular anomalies (602196). Pierre Robin sequence, hypoplastic scapulae, and 11 pairs of ribs are the primary features in family F and are nearly universal in both mild and severe forms of CMPD. However, Hill-Harfe et al. (2005) considered this case to represent either an etiologically distinct disorder or a mild form of CMPD because many other features of CMPD were not present. EVOLUTION Patel et al. (2001) examined the molecular evolution of DAX1 (300473), SRY (480000), and SOX9 genes involved in mammalian sex determination in 6 primate species. DAX1 and SRY were added to the X and Y chromosomes, respectively, during mammalian evolution, whereas SOX9 remained autosomal. They determined the genomic sequences of DAX1, SRY, and SOX9 in all 6 species, and calculated K(a), the number of nonsynonymous substitutions per nonsynonymous site, and compared this with the K(s), the number of synonymous substitutions per synonymous site. Phylogenetic trees were constructed by means of the DAX1, SRY, and SOX9 coding sequences, and phylogenetic analysis was performed using maximum likelihood. Overall measures of gene and protein similarity were closer for DAX1 and SOX9, but DAX1 exhibited nonsynonymous amino acid substitutions at an accelerated frequency relative to synonymous changes, similar to SRY and significantly higher than SOX9. Patel et al. (2001) concluded that, at the protein level, DAX1 and SRY are under less selective pressure to remain conserved than SOX9, and, therefore, diverge more across species than does SOX9. These results were consistent with evolutionary stratification of the mammalian sex determination pathway, analogous to that for sex chromosomes which may be evolving by punctuated sequential events (Lahn and Page, 1997, 1999). ANIMAL MODEL Studying the expression of mouse Sox9 during embryogenesis, Wright et al. (1995) found that the gene is expressed predominantly in mesenchymal condensations throughout the embryo before and during the deposition of cartilage, consistent with a primary role in skeletal formation. The expression pattern and chromosomal location of Sox9 suggested that it may be the gene defective in the mouse skeletal mutant 'Tail-short,' a potential animal model for campomelic dysplasia. To analyze Sox9 function during sex determination in mice, Vidal et al. (2001) ectopically expressed this gene in XX gonads. They showed that Sox9 is sufficient to induce testis formation in mice, indicating that it can substitute for the sex-determining gene Sry. Akiyama et al. (2002) conditionally deleted the Sox9 gene in mice to examine its contribution at different steps in chondrocyte differentiation. Inactivation of Sox9 in limb buds before mesenchymal condensations resulted in complete absence of cartilage and bone and loss of Sox5 (604975), Sox6 (607257), and Runx2 (600211) expression. Markers for the different axes of limb development were unaffected. Apoptotic domains within the developing limbs were expanded, suggesting that Sox9 suppresses apoptosis. Deletion of Sox9 expression after mesenchymal condensations resulted in a severe generalized chondrodysplasia. Most cells arrested as condensed mesenchymal cells and did not undergo overt differentiation into chondrocytes. Chondrocyte proliferation was inhibited, expression of genes associated with chondrocyte proliferation was downregulated, and joint formation was defective. Akiyama et al. (2002) concluded that SOX9 is needed to prevent conversion of proliferating chondrocytes into hypertrophic chondrocytes and that SOX9 is required during sequential steps of the chondrocyte differentiation pathway. SOX9 has essential roles in endochondral bone formation during axial and appendicular skeletogenesis. Because SOX9 is also expressed in neural crest cells, Mori-Akiyama et al. (2003) studied its function in neural crest. As many craniofacial skeletal elements are derived from cranial neural crest cells, the authors hypothesized that deletion of Sox9 in cranial neural crest cells of mice using the Cre recombinase/loxP recombination system would affect craniofacial development. They found that inactivation of Sox9 in neural crest resulted in a complete absence of cartilages and endochondral bones derived from the cranial neural crest. In contrast, all of the mesodermal skeletal elements and intramembranous bones were essentially conserved. Migration and localization of the Sox9 null mutant cranial neural crest cells were normal. In mouse embryo chimeras, Sox9 null mutant cells migrated to their correct location in endochondral skeletal elements; however, the deficient cranial neural crest cells were unable to contribute chondrogenic mesenchymal condensations. Mori-Akiyama et al. (2003) suggested that these cells changed their cell fate and acquired the ability to differentiate into osteoblasts. Stolt et al. (2003) ablated Sox9 from mouse neural stem cells to study its role in the switch from neurogenesis to gliogenesis during spinal cord development. Mutant mice exhibited an early and dramatic reduction in progenitors of the myelin-forming oligodendrocytes, but oligodendrocyte progenitor numbers recovered at later stages of development. Astrocyte numbers were severely reduced and did not recover at later stages. Stolt et al. (2003) concluded that SOX9 is a major molecular component of the neuron-glia switch in developing spinal cord.

comment: CLONING By screening human brain cDNAs for the potential to encode proteins that are at least 50 kD, Ishikawa et al. (1997) isolated an MTSS1 cDNA, which they called KIAA0429. The cDNA encodes a deduced 356-amino acid protein. Using a modified differential display technique to analyze human bladder cancer cell lines, Lee et al. (2002) identified MTSS1, which was not expressed in metastatic cells. They designated the gene MIM (missing in metastasis) and found that it contains a proline-rich region and an actin-binding Wiskott-Aldrich syndrome protein homology-2 motif (WH2). It has a predicted molecular mass of 38 kD. Northern blot analysis revealed expression of a 5.3-kb MTSS1 transcript in human spleen, thymus, prostate, testis, uterus, colon, and peripheral blood. Expression was not seen in 1 metastatic breast cancer cell line or in 2 metastatic prostate cancer cell lines. Mattila et al. (2003) cloned mouse Mtss1 and found that it encodes 2 isoforms: a primary protein of 759 amino acids and a less abundant shorter protein. The human and mouse proteins share 96% sequence identity. Northern blot analysis of adult mouse tissues showed strong expression of Mtss1 in liver, and moderate expression in kidney, heart, lung, spleen, and brain. RNA in situ hybridization demonstrated expression in embryonic central nervous system, heart, and muscle cells, and in adult kidney, liver, and Purkinje cells. Using in situ hybridization, Callahan et al. (2004) detected MIM transcripts in the outer root sheath of anagen hair follicles, but not in the interfollicular epithelium. MIM RNA and protein also accumulated at sites of inappropriately active sonic hedgehog (SHH; 600725) signaling, such as tumor epithelium of human basal cell carcinomas. GENE FUNCTION Mattila et al. (2003) showed that the C-terminal half of mouse Mtss1 protein, which contains the WH2 domain, binds actin monomers. Steady state and kinetic assembly assays showed that Mtss1 inhibits pointed-end actin assembly and actin monomer nucleotide exchange. Overexpression of Mtss1 in NIH 3T3 cells caused formation of abnormal actin structures. Callahan et al. (2004) showed that MIM is an SHH-responsive gene that can potentiate the transcriptional activity of GLI1 (165220) and GLI2 (165230). MIM and GLI1 acted synergistically to recapitulate SHH-mediated epidermal proliferation and invasion in regenerated human skin. Coimmunoprecipitation and protein-binding studies indicated that MIM is part of a GLI/suppressor of fused (SUFU; 607035) complex. SUFU appeared to associate with MIM in the absence of GLI. Mutation analysis indicated that an N-terminal domain of MIM distinct from those used for monomeric actin binding was required for both complex association and transcriptional potentiation. MAPPING By radiation hybrid analysis, Ishikawa et al. (1997) mapped the MTSS1 gene to chromosome 8. By genomic sequence analysis, Lee et al. (2002) localized the gene to 8q24.1.

comment: CLONING By screening EST databases for retina-specific genes, followed by 5-prime and 3-prime RACE, Conte et al. (2002) cloned full-length RP1L1. The deduced 2,464-amino acid protein contains 2 N-terminal doublecortin (DC) domains, 2 imperfect repeats of a 16-amino acid module, and 2 C-terminal coiled-coil domains. RP1L1 shares 39% amino acid identity with mouse Rp1l1, with highest identity in the N-terminal region. Mouse Rp1l1 does not contain the coiled-coil domain or the 2 repeats found in human RP1L1. RP1L1 also shares significant similarity in the N-terminal DC domains with RP1 (603937). Semiquantitative RT-PCR showed RP1L1 expression only in retina. Northern blot analysis of adult mouse tissues detected 2 weak bands of about 7.5 and 5.0 kb only in retina. EST database analysis detected RP1L1 sequences only in retina and eye cDNA libraries. By EST database analysis, followed by 5-prime and 3-prime RACE of a retina cDNA library, Bowne et al. (2003) cloned several RP1L1 cDNAs. The length of the RP1L1 transcript is more than 7 kb, but the exact length varies among individuals due to the presence of a 48-bp polymorphic repeat. Bowne et al. (2003) determined that the shortest common mRNA has a single 48-bp sequence and encodes a deduced 2,400-amino acid protein; however, they identified as many as six 48-bp repeats in normal individuals. Another large repetitive region is present near the 3-prime end of the RP1L1 transcript. Both repetitive regions contain a high percentage of glutamine and glutamic acid residues. RP1L1 also uses 3 different polyadenylation signals. Bowne et al. (2003) also identified mouse RP1L1, which encodes a deduced 1,859-amino acid protein that lacks both the 48-bp polymorphic repeat and the repetitive region found in human RP1L1. Northern blot analysis of human and mouse tissues showed expression limited to retina. RT-PCR detected Rp1l1 in mouse retinas at birth, but not at any prenatal time point analyzed, suggesting that Rp1l1 expression coincides with development of photoreceptors. Furthermore, Rp1l1 expression was significantly reduced in mice lacking photoreceptors. In situ hybridization detected Rp1l1 in the inner segments of mouse photoreceptors. GENE STRUCTURE Conte et al. (2002) determined that the RP1L1 gene contains 4 exons and spans 52 kb. Bowne et al. (2003) determined that the first exon is noncoding, while the large fourth exon contains the majority of the coding sequence. The RP1L1 gene structure is similar to the RP1 gene structure. MAPPING By genomic database analysis, Conte et al. (2002) mapped the RP1L1 gene to chromosome 8p23.2, where it lies 122 kb proximal to the SOX7 gene and about 319 kb distal to the MSRA gene (601250). They mapped the mouse Rp1l1 gene to chromosome 14 in a region that shows homology of synteny to human chromosome 8p23. Bowne et al. (2003) mapped the mouse Rp1l1 gene to chromosome 14E1. MOLECULAR GENETICS By analysis of the RP1L1 gene in 60 probands with autosomal dominant retinitis pigmentosa (see 180100), Bowne et al. (2003) identified a polymorphic 16-amino acid repeat, a common 21-bp deletion, and numerous polymorphic missense and silent substitutions. However, despite the large amount of variation in RP1L1, no disease-causing mutations were identified.

comment: DESCRIPTION ADM2 belongs to a family of calcitonin (114130)-related peptide hormones important for regulating diverse physiologic functions and the chemical composition of fluids and tissues. CLONING By searching databases for sequences sharing primary and secondary structures with calcitonin family peptides, followed by PCR of a pituitary cDNA library, Roh et al. (2004) cloned ADM2, which they designated intermedin. The deduced 148-amino acid preproprotein contains an N-terminal signal peptide. The C-terminal half of ADM2 contains a dibasic cleavage site, followed by a 47-amino acid mature peptide hormone sequence and an alpha-amidation donor glycine at the C terminus. Immunohistochemical analysis of several mouse tissues detected Adm2 in pituitary and stomach. PCR analysis of a human gastrointestinal panel detected ADM2 in almost all regions examined. Immunohistochemical staining showed ADM2 in the muscularis mucosae layer of stomach. Western blot analysis of transfected embryonic kidney cells found mature ADM2 secreted into the culture medium; the apparent molecular mass was about 5.0 kD. By searching EST and genomic sequence databases for similarity with pufferfish Am2, followed by screening a kidney cDNA library, Takei et al. (2004) cloned ADM2. RT-PCR of mouse tissues showed high Adm2 expression in submaxillary gland, ovary, kidney, stomach, and mesentery, with lower expression in pituitary, lung, pancreas, intestine, spleen, and thymus. GENE FUNCTION Roh et al. (2004) found that ADM2 was a nonselective agonist for RAMP coreceptors (see RAMP1; 605153) in a receptor binding assay. In vivo studies demonstrated that ADM2 treatment led to blood pressure reduction in both normal and spontaneously hypertensive rats via interaction with the CRLR (114190)/RAMP receptor complexes. Furthermore, in vivo treatment of mice with ADM2 led to suppression of gastric emptying activity and food intake. Takei et al. (2004) found that intravenous injection of synthetic mature ADM2 decreased arterial pressure more potently than ADM (103275) and induced antidiuresis and antinatriuresis in mice. They concluded that ADM2 plays a role in cardiovascular and body fluid regulation. GENE STRUCTURE Takei et al. (2004) determined that the coding region of the ADM2 gene contains 2 exons. MAPPING By genomic sequence analysis, Roh et al. (2004) mapped the ADM2 gene to chromosome 22q13. They mapped the mouse Adm2 gene to a region on chromosome 15 that shows homology of synteny to human chromosome 22q13. In both genomes, ADM2 maps near an aldehyde reductase-like gene (ALDRL6; 606774). Takei et al. (2004) noted that the gene cluster that colocalizes with the ADM2 gene on chromosome 22, MAPK8IP2 (607755), ALDRL6, PARVB (608121), and SOX10 (602229), is similar to the cluster that colocalizes with the ADM gene on chromosome 11.

comment: A number sign (#) is used with this entry because limb-girdle muscular dystrophy type 2J (LGMD2J) is caused by homozygous mutation in the titin gene (TTN; 188840). Heterozygous mutation in the titin gene causes tardive tibial muscular dystrophy (TMD; 600334). Mutation in the titin gene also causes dilated cardiomyopathy type 1G (CMD1G; 604145). For a general description and a discussion of genetic heterogeneity of autosomal recessive limb-girdle muscular dystrophy, see LGMD2A (253600). CLINICAL FEATURES Udd et al. (1991, 1992) reported a large consanguineous Finnish pedigree in which 12 members had mild late-onset distal tibial myopathy (see TMD) inherited in an autosomal dominant pattern and 8 members had a severe limb-girdle muscular dystrophy inherited in an autosomal recessive pattern. Both groups had nonspecific myopathic changes on muscle biopsy and progressive fatty infiltration of involved muscles. Onset of the severe LGMD phenotype was in the first to third decades and involved weakness of all proximal muscles. Severe disability with loss of ambulation occurred within 20 years (third to sixth decades). There was no facial muscle involvement or cardiomyopathy. Some patients later developed distal muscle involvement. Segregation analysis showed that the corrected proportion of affected persons with the severe proximal type was 0.246 and the proportion of affected persons with the distal myopathy was 0.58. The findings were compatible with the hypothesis that the severe LGMD phenotype was the homozygous manifestation of a dominant gene that in the heterozygous state caused the milder distal myopathy (Udd, 1992). In muscle biopsies from a patient with limb-girdle muscular dystrophy who was homozygous for a TMD haplotype, Haravuori et al. (2001) found almost complete loss of calpain-3 (CAPN3; 114240), a ligand of titin. The authors concluded that the loss of calpain-3 is a secondary downstream effect of deficiency of the TMD gene protein and results in phenotypic overlap with LGMD2A, which is caused by mutation in the calpain-3 gene. MAPPING By genomewide scan of the large Finnish family with LGMD and TMD reported by Udd et al. (1992), Haravuori et al. (1997, 1998) found a region of interest on 2q. Further analyses with additional family members and additional families with TMD, yielded a maximum multipoint lod score of 12.4 with marker D2S324. Haplotype analysis revealed the same core haplotype in all analyzed families, providing evidence for an ancestral mutation, further restricting the critical chromosomal region to about 1 cM, and mapping the disease locus to chromosome 2q31. Three patients with the more severe LGMD phenotype were homozygous for the haplotype, whereas those with the milder TMD phenotype were heterozygous. MOLECULAR GENETICS In patients with LGMD2J from the large Finnish family reported by Udd et al. (1992), Hackman et al. (2002) identified homozygosity for an 11-bp deletion/insertion in the last exon (exon 363) of the TTN gene (188840.0004). Family members affected with the milder adult-onset TMD phenotype were heterozygous for the TTN deletion. NOMENCLATURE According to the report of the 105th ENMC workshop, the phenotype of the homozygous TTN gene mutation is termed 'LGMD2J' (Bushby and Beckmann, 2003).

comment: DESCRIPTION Members of the F-box protein family, such as FBXO15, are characterized by an approximately 40-amino acid F-box motif. SCF complexes, formed by SKP1 (601434), cullin (see CUL1; 603134), and F-box proteins, act as protein-ubiquitin ligases. F-box proteins interact with SKP1 through the F box, and they interact with ubiquitination targets through other protein interaction domains (Jin et al., 2004). CLONING Using SKP1 as bait in a yeast 2-hybrid screen, and by searching an EST database, Winston et al. (1999) identified several F box proteins, including mouse Fbx15. The deduced protein contains an F box in its N-terminal half. By EST database analysis, Tokuzawa et al. (2003) determined that mouse Fbx15 is predominantly expressed in embryonic stem (ES) cells and early mouse embryos. RT-PCR detected expression in testis and ovary, but not in any other adult mouse tissue examined. Western blot analysis of mouse ES cell lines detected Fbx15 at an apparent molecular mass of 55 kD. GENE FUNCTION Winston et al. (1999) showed that in vitro translated mouse Fbxo15 interacted with SKP1 in an in vitro binding assay and in transfected human embryonic kidney cells. By Western blot analysis of mouse ES cell lines, Tokuzawa et al. (2003) determined that expression of Fbx15 was downregulated upon differentiation induced by retinoic acid. Inactivation of Oct3/Oct4 (PO5F1; 164177) in ES cells also led to rapid extinction of Fbx15 expression. Reporter gene analysis demonstrated that this ES cell-specific expression required an 18-bp enhancer element located upstream from the transcription initiation site. The enhancer contains an octamer-like motif and an adjacent Sox (see SOX2; 184429)-binding motif. Deletion or point mutation of either motif abolished the enhancer activity. The 18-bp fragment became active in mouse fibroblasts when Oct3/Oct4 and Sox2 were coexpressed. Gel mobility shift assay demonstrated cooperative binding of Oct3/Oct4 and Sox2 to the Fbx15 enhancer sequence. MAPPING Jin et al. (2004) stated that the FBXO15 gene maps to chromosome 18q22.3 and the mouse Fbxo15 gene maps to chromosome 18E4.0. ANIMAL MODEL Tokuzawa et al. (2003) found that mice homozygous for Fbx15 deletion showed no gross developmental defects and were fertile. Fbx15 null ES cells showed normal morphology, proliferation, and differentiation.

comment: A number sign (#) is used with this entry because of evidence that the neurologic variant of Waardenburg-Shah syndrome is caused by mutation in the SOX10 gene (602229). DESCRIPTION The neurologic variant of Waardenburg-Shah syndrome is a complex neurocristopathy that includes features of 4 distinct syndromes: peripheral demyelinating neuropathy (see 118200), central dysmyelinating leukodystrophy (see 312080), Waardenburg syndrome (see WS4; 277580), and Hirschsprung disease (see 142623) (Inoue et al., 2004). Inoue et al. (2004) proposed the acronym PCWH for this disorder. CLINICAL FEATURES Inoue et al. (1999) reported an 11-year-old Japanese girl with Waardenburg-Shah syndrome and neurologic abnormalities, including severe leukodystrophy compatible with Pelizaeus-Merzbacher disease (312080) and peripheral neuropathy consistent with Charcot-Marie-Tooth disease type I (see 118200). The patient was born at near term, weighing 2.1 kg, and presenting with neonatal asphyxia with an Apgar score of 4 at 5 minutes. Soon after birth, a series of operations were performed to correct her long-segment Hirschsprung disease. She also had heterochromia iridis, profound neurosensory deafness, a broad nasal root, and dystopia canthorum. She had severe developmental delay and never held her head upright or crawled or sat alone. She had been bedridden since birth with spastic quadraplegia. Loss of deep tendon reflexes and sensory dullness suggested peripheral neuropathy. Electrophysiologic studies showed reduced motor nerve conduction velocities in all nerves tested. The muscles in all limbs were severely atrophic. Protein in the cerebrospinal fluid was elevated to 62 mg/dl. She had no auditory brainstem response bilaterally. Head MRI scanning showed prominent deficiency of myelination in the entire brain. Touraine et al. (2000) reported 3 unrelated patients from Europe with a neurologic variant of Waardenburg-Shah syndrome. The first patient had early delayed developmental milestones, nystagmus, myopia, reduced tear production, hypotonia, and growth deficiency. In addition to extensive intestinal aganglionosis, deafness, iris heterochromia, and hypomelanic skin patches consistent with Waardenburg-Shah syndrome, the patient developed cerebellar ataxia, spasticity, and severe mental retardation. Evidence of autonomic dysregulation was also found. There was almost no local reaction to the histamine test. He developed hepatosplenomegaly and portal hypertension of unknown origin. Three other boys who were members of his family had died during the first week of life; they had intestinal obstruction and it was likely that they had Waardenburg syndrome, since the third child had patchy depigmentation of the scalp and white hair. Neither the mother nor any other family member had any signs of WS or Hirschsprung disease. The second patient was initially diagnosed with short-segment aganglionosis; he then presented with myoclonus at age 2 weeks. He later developed nystagmus, head bobbing, and paroxysmal movement of the upper limbs. On the basis of a later occurrence of torticollis and the benign course of the nystagmus, head bobbing, and paroxysmal movement, a putative diagnosis of spasmus nutans was made. Ataxia, spasticity, and reduced production of tears, saliva, and sweat developed progressively. Growth failure was noted by age 8 years. He had neither hypomelanic lesions nor hepatosplenomegaly. Neither of his parents or any other family member had signs of WS or Hirschsprung disease. The third patient had severe neonatal distress that required immediate resuscitation and admission to an intensive care unit. He presented with coma, arthrogryposis, meconium ileus, and a white forelock, but did not have heterochromia iridis. Severe aganglionosis extending to the jejunum was identified. Neither auditory brainstem-evoked responses nor electromyographic reactivity could be found. Electroencephalogram was abnormal, showing immaturity and discontinuity of the tracing, but paroxysmal discharges were not present. Analysis of muscle biopsy showed no specific lesions. The child died on day 11 of life. MOLECULAR GENETICS In 3 patients with the neurologic variant of Waardenburg-Shah syndrome, Touraine et al. (2000) identified heterozygosity for 1 of 2 truncating mutations in the SOX10 gene: tyr313 to ter (Y313X; 602229.0006) or ser251 to ter (S251X; 602229.0007). The extended spectrum of the Waardenburg-Shah syndrome phenotype was considered relevant to the brain expression of SOX10 during human embryonic and fetal development. In a patient with Waardenburg-Shah syndrome and neurologic abnormalities, Inoue et al. (1999) identified a mutation in the SOX10 gene (602229.0008) that did not disrupt the coding region but extended the peptide and hence was thought to act as a dominant-negative allele. The healthy parents and sibs did not have the mutation, indicating that it was de novo. Pingault et al. (2000) and Inoue et al. (2002) also identified SOX10 mutations in patients with Waardenburg-Shah syndrome and neurologic abnormalities. In 2 patients with PCWH, one of whom had previously been reported by Jacobs and Wilson (1992), Inoue et al. (2004) found the Y313X mutation in the SOX10 gene. Both patients had muscle wasting/atrophy, pes cavus, and areflexia/hyporeflexia, indicating peripheral neuropathy. Both had developmental delay and hypotonia, indicative of dysmyelinating leukodystrophy, with nystagmus and spastic diplegia also present in the younger patient. Both patients had hypopigmentation and neurosensory deafness, indicating dysmyelinating Waardenburg syndrome, and both had long segment Hirschsprung disease. In another patient with PCWH, Inoue et al. (2004) identified a gln250-to-ter (Q250X; 602229.0011) mutation in the SOX10 gene. GENOTYPE/PHENOTYPE CORRELATIONS In addition to causing the neurologic variant of Waardenburg-Shah syndrome, mutations in the SOX10 gene also cause Waardenburg-Shah syndrome (277580), which has a more restricted phenotype. Inoue et al. (2004) reported that although all nonsense and frameshift mutations that cause premature termination of translation generate truncated SOX10 proteins with potent dominant-negative activity, the more severe disease phenotype (the neurologic variant) is realized only when the mutant mRNAs escape the nonsense-mediated decay (NMD) pathway. They observed similar results for truncating mutations of MPZ (159440), which convey a number of distinct myelinopathies. These observations indicated that triggering NMD and escaping NMD may be critical factors in the resulting neurologic phenotype.

comment: Megarbane et al. (2003) described a brother and sister in a Sunni Muslim community in Lebanon who were the offspring of consanguineous parents. The patients presented with an apparently 'new' syndrome consisting of congenital hearing loss, meatal atresia, preauricular tags and pits, branchial cysts or fistulae, strabismus, difficulty in opening the mouth wide, abnormal fifth fingers, somewhat short stature, and learning disability and patchy skin depigmentation in one. Temporal bone abnormalities identified on computed tomography included atresia of the external auditory canal with reduction in size of the middle ear, malformed ossicles, and unilateral internal auditory canal hypoplasia. Hand radiographs showed pointed phalanges of the fifth fingers with osseous erosions. The father, his sister, and his half-brother had unilateral auricular pits and/or branchial cysts and short stature. All laboratory investigations were normal. Specifically, no sequence abnormality of the EYA1 gene (601653) was detected. Despite the consanguinity, Megarbane et al. (2003) concluded that this might represent a new dominant branchiogenic-deafness syndrome, in light of the variable expressivity on the father's side of the family.

(2003), Sasse-Klaassen et al. (2004) reported linkage studies demonstrating a locus for autosomal dominant LVNC in 11p15. A peak 2-point LOD score of 5.06 was obtained with marker D11S902 at theta = 0. Haplotype analysis defined a critical interval of 6.4 centimorgans between D11S1794 and D11S928, corresponding to a physical distance of 6.8 megabases. No disease-causing mutation was identified in 2 prime positional candidate genes located in the critical region of mapping: that encoding for muscle LIM protein (CSRP3; 600824) and that encoding for SOX6 (607257).

comment: DESCRIPTION SOSTDC1 belongs to a class of bone morphogenetic protein (BMP) antagonists that bind BMPs and regulate their signaling during cellular proliferation, differentiation, and programmed cell death (Yanagita et al., 2004). CLONING By searching a genomic database for sequences similar to mouse ectodin, followed by PCR of a human brain cDNA library, Laurikkala et al. (2003) cloned human SOSTDC1, which they called ectodin. The deduced 206-amino acid protein has a 22-amino acid N-terminal signal sequence and a core cysteine-rich region. Ectodin has 6 conserved cysteines and a glycine predicted to form a cystine knot with 4 disulfide bridges, and the spacing of cysteines is highly homologous to BMP antagonists in the DAN (600613)/cerberus (see 603777) family. Mouse and human ectodin share 95% amino acid identity. Laurikkala et al. (2003) identified ectodin orthologs in zebrafish and frog databases, but not in fly and nematode databases, suggesting that ectodin is vertebrate specific. Real-time quantitative RT-PCR detected abundant expression in mouse kidney. In mouse embryo, ectodin was expressed at the surfaces of the mandibular, maxillary, and frontonasal processes at embryonic day 11, and was later expressed in the vibrissae, tylotrich hair follicles, tongue papillae, tooth germ, ear auricle, kidney epithelium in the stalk and tips of ureter, spermatic ducts in testis, and dorsal root and other ganglia; ovaries were negative. Nonreducing SDS-PAGE of in vitro translated cDNA indicated that ectodin is secreted as a monomer. During a search of kidney-specific transcripts, Yanagita et al. (2004) identified SOSTDC1, which they called USAG1, as an ortholog of a rat gene preferentially expressed in sensitized endometrium. The deduced rat and human proteins share 97% amino acid identity. Yanagita et al. (2004) identified 2 putative N-glycosylation sites in the human protein. His-tagged USAG1 was secreted as 2 major bands of 28 to 30 kD from transfected COS-7 cells. In the early stage of mouse embryogenesis, Usag1 was expressed in the first and second branchial arches and in metanephros, while in later stages expression was confined to renal tubules and ameloblasts of teeth. Postnatally, Usag1 expression was further restricted to distal renal tubules in a pattern similar to the localization of Bmp7 (112267). GENE FUNCTION Laurikkala et al. (2003) demonstrated that recombinant mouse ectodin inhibited Bmp2 (112261), Bmp4 (112262), Bmp6 (112266), and Bmp7 activity in a mouse preosteoblastic cell line, and ectodin bound these BMPs with high affinity in vitro. Recombinant ectodin antagonized BMP-mediated induction of Msx2 (123101) in cultured mouse tooth explants, indicating that ectodin is a secreted BMP inhibitor. In a feedback loop, recombinant human BMP2 and BMP7 stimulated ectodin expression. This stimulation was prevented by SHH (600725) and FGF4 (164980), but not by WNT6 (604663), which are coexpressed with BMPs in the enamel knot, a signaling center in developing teeth. Laurikkala et al. (2003) concluded that ectodin is a novel BMP inhibitor that integrates BMP signaling with the SHH and FGF signaling pathways and contributes to the spatiotemporal BMP target field around ectodermal signaling centers. Yanagita et al. (2004) found that recombinant USAG1 bound directly to BMPs and antagonized BMP-mediated induction of alkaline phosphatase in a mouse myoblast cell line. USAG1 induced formation of secondary axis and/or hyperdorsalization in Xenopus embryos. GENE STRUCTURE Laurikkala et al. (2003) determined that the SOSTDC1 gene contains 2 exons. MAPPING By genomic sequence analysis, Laurikkala et al. (2003) mapped the SOSTDC1 gene to chromosome 7p21.2. ANIMAL MODEL Kassai et al. (2005) reported that ectodin, a secreted bone morphogenetic protein (BMP) inhibitor, is expressed as a 'negative' image of mouse enamel knots. Furthermore, they showed that ectodin-deficient mice have enlarged enamel knots, highly altered cusp patterns, and extra teeth. Unlike in normal teeth, excess BMP accelerated patterning in ectodin-deficient teeth. Kassai et al. (2005) proposed that ectodin is critical for robust spatial delineation of enamel knots and cusps. Yanagita et al. (2006) found Usag1-null mice were viable, fertile, and appeared healthy, with the exception of dental abnormalities noted previously. However, they found Usag1-null mice were resistant to renal injury caused by administration of a nephrotoxic agent and showed significantly higher 3-day survival than their wildtype littermates. Renal Bmp (see BMP7; 112267) signaling, assessed by phosphorylation of Smad proteins (see SMAD1; 601595), was significantly enhanced in Usag1-null mice with renal injury. Administration of a neutralizing antibody against Bmp7 abolished renal protection in Usag1-null mice. Yanagita et al. (2006) concluded that USAG1 plays a critical role in modulating the renal protective action of BMP.

comment: CLONING By sequencing clones obtained from a size-fractionated fetal brain cDNA library, Nagase et al. (2000) cloned CTTNBP2, which they designated KIAA1758. Using a gene prediction program to find genes in the candidate region for autism on chromosome 7q31 (see 608636), Cheung et al. (2001) identified and cloned CTTNBP2, which they called CORTBP2. CTTNBP2 encodes a deduced 1,663-amino acid protein containing 6 ankyrin repeats and several proline-rich regions that are likely to interact with the SH3 domain of cortactin (164765). Cheung et al. (2001) also identified partial sequences of orthologs in rat and mouse. Northern blot analysis detected a 6-kb CTTNBP2 transcript in multiple human tissues, with highest expression in brain, kidney, and pancreas. A brain-specific Northern blot revealed expression in all subsections examined. GENE STRUCTURE Cheung et al. (2001) determined that the CTTNBP2 gene contains 23 exons encompassing 170 kb. MAPPING By sequence analysis, Cheung et al. (2001) mapped the CTTNBP2 gene to chromosome 7q31, between CFTR (602421) and KCND2 (605410). MOLECULAR GENETICS Cheung et al.

comment: CLONING Gallo et al. (2002) cloned mouse Kctd11, which they called Ren. The deduced 232-amino acid protein has an apparent molecular mass of 26 kD and contains an N-terminal BTB/POZ domain and several sites for N-myristoylation and phosphorylation. Northern blot analysis detected Ren expression in adult lung and day-7 mouse embryos. RT-PCR detected peak Ren expression at embryonic day 8.5, with decreasing levels thereafter. In situ hybridization showed that Ren was expressed in the neural fold epithelium of the mouse embryo during gastrulation, and subsequently throughout the ventral neural tube, the outer layer of the ventricular encephalic neuroepithelium, and in neural crest derivatives, including dorsal root ganglia. By searching databases for sequences similar to mouse Ren, followed by RT-PCR and RACE of cerebellum, medulloblastoma, and keratinocyte cell lines, Di Marcotullio et al. (2004) cloned human REN. The deduced 232-amino acid protein has an N-terminal BTB/POZ domain and shares 91% amino acid identity with mouse Ren. Northern blot analysis detected a 2.9-kb REN transcript in whole brain and cerebellum and in a human medulloblastoma cell line. GENE FUNCTION Gallo et al. (2002) found that Ren was upregulated by neurogenic signals, such as retinoic acid, EGF (131530), and NGF (NGFB; 162030), in pluripotent mouse embryonic stem cells and in rat neural progenitor cell lines in association with neuronal differentiation. Ren overexpression induced neuronal differentiation, growth arrest, and p27(KIP1) (CDKN1B; 600778) expression in central and peripheral neural progenitor cell lines. Inhibition of Ren impaired retinoic acid induction of neurogenin-1 (NEUROG1; 601726) and NeuroD (NEUROD1; 601724) expression. Because REN maps to a region of chromosome 17 frequently deleted in medulloblastomas, Di Marcotullio et al. (2004) analyzed primary medulloblastomas and medulloblastoma cell lines for REN ploidy. One REN allele was deleted in 7 of 18 primary tumor samples and in 4 of 6 cell lines examined. REN transcript levels were 5-fold lower in hemizygous medulloblastoma cell lines and primary tumors than in normal cerebellar tissue. There was a 50% decrease in REN mRNA in REN +/+ tumors and cell lines, indicating that REN expression is downregulated in medulloblastomas by mechanisms other than allelic loss. Di Marcotullio et al. (2004) found that REN inhibited medulloblastoma cell proliferation and colony formation in vitro and suppressed xenograft tumor growth in athymic nude mice. REN antagonized Gli1 (GLI; 165220)-mediated transactivation of hedgehog (see SHH; 600725) target genes by affecting Gli1 nuclear transfer, and the growth inhibitory activity of REN was impaired by Gli1 inactivation, suggesting that REN inhibits medulloblastoma growth by negatively regulating the hedgehog pathway. Di Marcotullio et al. (2004) concluded that REN is a suppressor of hedgehog signaling and that its inactivation leads to deregulation of the tumor-promoting hedgehog pathway in medulloblastomas. GENE STRUCTURE Di Marcotullio et al. (2004) determined that the KCTD11 gene is intronless. MAPPING By genomic sequence analysis, Di Marcotullio et al. (2004) mapped the KCTD11 gene to chromosome 17p13.2. They mapped the mouse Kctd11 gene to a region of chromosome 11 that shares homology of synteny with human chromosome 17p13.2.

comment: DESCRIPTION Ethanolamine kinase (ATP:ethanolamine O-phosphotransferase; EC 2.7.1.82) catalyzes the first step in phosphatidylethanolamine (PtdEtn) biosynthesis via the CDP-Etn pathway (Lykidis et al., 2001). CLONING By searching for sequences similar to the Drosophila ethanolamine kinase (eas) gene, followed by RT-PCR of liver RNA, Lykidis et al. (2001) cloned human ETNK1, which they called EKI1. The deduced 452-amino acid protein has a calculated molecular mass of 49.7 kD. EKI1 contains a region rich in hydrophobic residues and a putative transmembrane helix. In transfected cells, however, EKI1 associated with the cytosolic fraction rather than the membrane fraction. Northern blot analysis detected a 2.2-kb EKI1 transcript in all tissues examined and an additional 1.7-kb EKI1 transcript in testis. GENE FUNCTION Lykidis et al. (2001) found that overexpression of human EKI1 in COS-7 cells increased incorporation of radiolabeled ethanolamine into PtdEtn. Accelerating the CDP-Etn pathway did not elevate cellular PtdEtn levels, since excess PtdEtn was degraded. EKI1 had negligible choline kinase activity in vitro, and overexpression did not influence phosphatidylcholine biosynthesis. Acceleration of the CDP-Etn pathway did not change the rate of PtdEtn formation via decarboxylation of phosphatidylserine. Zafarana et al. (2002) identified the DADR (609860), SOX5 (604975), and ETNK1 genes within a region of chromosome 12p amplified in testicular seminomas (273300). Although all 3 genes were amplified to the same level in seminomas with the amplification, only DADR expression was significantly upregulated. GENE STRUCTURE Lykidis et al. (2001) determined that the ETNK1 gene contains 8 exons and spans about 60.5 kb. MAPPING By genomic sequence analysis, Lykidis et al. (2001) mapped the ETNK1 gene to chromosome 12 in both human and mouse. Zafarana et al. (2002) mapped the ETNK1 gene to chromosome 12p12.1-p11.2 by sequence analysis.

In mouse embryos, tectonic was expressed in regions that participate in hedgehog (see SHH; 600725) signaling. It was first expressed during gastrulation stages in the ventral node. At embryonic day 9.5, it was expressed in the gut endoderm, limb buds, notochord, somites, neural tube, and floorplate. GENE FUNCTION Reiter and Skarnes (2006) found that mouse tectonic modulated hedgehog (see SHH; 600725) signaling downstream of smoothened (SMOH; 601500) and Rab23 (606144) and was required for maximal hedgehog activation. GENE STRUCTURE Reiter and Skarnes (2006) determined that the mouse tectonic gene contains 13 exons. MAPPING The International Radiation Hybrid Mapping Consortium mapped the TECT1 gene to chromosome 12 (TMAP RH68803). Reiter and Skarnes (2006) mapped the mouse tectonic gene to chromosome 5. ANIMAL MODEL Reiter and Skarnes (2006) found that tectonic-null mice died between embryonic days 13.5 and 16.5 and displayed holoprosencephaly. V3 interneurons were lost in tectonic mutants. Loss of ventral neural markers in tectonic-null mice was accompanied by a ventral expansion of genes normally restricted to more dorsal domains. Examination of tectonic-Shh double mutants showed that tectonic could repress as well as activate hedgehog signaling.

comment: In the course of screening 83 familial and 327 sporadic DNA samples from patients with holoprosencephaly, previously screened for mutations in the CFC1 gene (605194) (Bamford et al., 2000), de la Cruz et al. (2002) found a pro125-to-leu (P125L) mutation in the CFC domain of TDGF1 in a 2-year-old male child with developmental delay, relatively minor craniofacial findings, small head size, and dysplastic forebrain. Midline anomalies, such as absence of the septum pellucidum and hypoplastic corpus callosum, were present. The mother was not a mutation carrier; the father was not available. The mutant protein was inactive in a zebrafish rescue assay. It was suggested by de la Cruz et al. (2002) that some of the differences between the phenotype of this patient and those more typical of holoprosencephaly reflect a difference in the mechanism of disease between factors that directly act on the forebrain, such as Sonic hedgehog (SHH; 600725) and those acting more indirectly on axial midline development, such as NODAL (601265).

comment: In 1 of 82 genetically unrelated patients with hypertrophic cardiomyopathy and no mutations in any of the 8 genes associated with this disorder, Satoh et al. (1999) identified a heterozygous 740G-T transversion in the TTN gene, resulting in an arg740-to-leu (R740L) substitution. The parents were deceased, and the few relatives available were unaffected. Functional expression studies showed that the mutation resulted in increased titin binding affinity for alpha-actinin (102575). See 188840.0007 for a nearby mutation (A743V) that causes decreased titin binding affinity to alpha-actinin, resulting in dilated cardiomyopathy (604145).

comment: In a large family with autosomal dominant dilated cardiomyopathy and linkage to 2q31 (604145), Gerull et al. (2002) found a 2-bp insertion mutation (43628AT) in exon 326 of the TTN gene, causing a frameshift that truncated A-band titin. The premature stop codon occurred after the addition of 4 novel amino acid residues. Puzzling was the absence of any clinically detectable phenotype in skeletal muscle. The 2 exons found to be affected in dilated cardiomyopathy by Gerull et al. (2002), namely exons 18 and 326, are both expressed in cardiac and noncardiac muscle isoforms. The truncated protein of approximately 2 mD was expressed in skeletal muscle, but Western blot studies with epitope-specific anti-titin antibodies suggested that the mutant protein was truncated to a 1.14-mD subfragment by site-specific cleavage. Clinical characteristics were described by Siu et al. (1999).

The mutation changed 4 amino acids close to the C-terminal end of the titin protein but did not cause a frameshift or a stop codon. Each of the 4 amino acids was changed to an amino acid of another charge, and the overall charge was changed from acidic to basic. The mutation was not found in 216 Finnish control samples. In 3 patients with limb-girdle muscular dystrophy type 2J (608807) from a large consanguineous Finnish family, Hackman et al. (2002) identified homozygosity for the TTN 11-bp deletion. Other members in the same family who were heterozygous for the 11-bp deletion manifested the less severe TMD phenotype.

Both patients had a history of cardiac arrhythmias (premature atrial or ventricular contraction and atrioventricular conduction block) before they developed dilated cardiomyopathy or congestive heart failure. The A743V mutation is located in the alpha-actinin (102575)-binding domain of titin, and functional studies showed that the mutation decreased the affinity of titin Z-repeats to alpha-actinin by about 40% compared to normal. The authors noted that the A743V mutation is located near the R740L (188840.0001) mutation, which was found in a patient with hypertrophic cardiomyopathy and results in increased titin-binding affinity to alpha-actinin.

comment: In 2 large unrelated Swedish families described by Nicolao et al. (1999) segregating Edstrom myopathy as an autosomal dominant, also known as hereditary myopathy with early respiratory failure (HMERF; 603689), Lange et al. (2005) identified a C-to-T transition in the TTN gene resulting in an arg-to-trp substitution at codon 279 (R279W) in the alpha-R1 region of the protein kinase regulatory tail of titin. This mutation showed complete segregation with the disease in the 2 families. The mutation was not reported in single-nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) databases and was not found in 200 normal Swedish controls. An additional Swedish patient with an identical phenotype but without known genealogic relation to anyone in the 2 original families was found to have the same mutation on the same haplotype, indicating a common ancestry. The R279W mutant protein kinase domain (TK) showed no difference in calmodulin (114180)-stimulated catalytic activity when compared with wildtype TK. However, the interaction of TK with NBR1 (166945) was dramatically reduced. In patient biopsies, NBR1 was localized abnormally diffusely in diseased muscle instead of being M band- and Z disk-associated, although in HMERF 50% of TK was expected to be wildtype. This suggested a dominant-negative mechanism of action for this mutation.

comment: In a family with mental retardation and isolated growth hormone deficiency (300123), Laumonnier et al. (2002) found that the SOX3 gene contained an in-frame duplication of 33 bp encoding for 11 alanines in a polyalanine tract. The family had been described clinically by Hamel et al. (1996) and by Hol et al. (2000). Clinical examination revealed facial anomalies in some but not all of the patients. On average, untreated patients reached their final height, ranging from 135 to 159 cm, at the age of 24 or 25 years. In all patients examined, behavior was considered infantile, and laboratory investigations demonstrated total growth hormone deficiency. Affected individuals in one family had an in-frame duplication of 33 bp (711-743dup) encoding for an additional 11-alanine tract. This duplication was predicted to cause expansion of the normal polyalanine tract (amino acids 234-249) by 15 to 26 alanine residues.

comment: Heussler et al. (2002) reported a large family ascertained for HPE (142945) in which the proband presented in utero with alobar holoprosencephaly and at post mortem was noted to have microcephaly, hypotelorism, and premaxillary agenesis. Analysis of the SHH gene in fetal DNA demonstrated a novel missense mutation which resulted from an A-to-T transition at nucleotide position 263. This was predicted to result in an asp88-to-val (D88V) amino acid substitution. This residue is located in the N-terminal signaling domain at an invariant position in the hedgehog family of proteins and is conserved in human, mouse, chicken, and zebrafish SHH and in Drosophila hedgehog. Although the functional effects of the V88D change were not studied, the authors suggested that this mutation probably caused an alteration in the biologic activity of SHH. The mutation was identified in other family members, and was associated with striking phenotypic variation. Two mutation carriers had attention difficulties, with one of them clinically diagnosed with attention deficit-hyperactivity disorder (143465). The authors suggested that the combination of microcephaly, hypotelorism, subtle midline facial anomalies, and attention deficit-hyperactivity disorder within a sibship should alert the physician to the possible diagnosis of HPE.

comment: Schimmenti et al. (2003) described an infant with bilateral iris, uveal, and retinal colobomas (120200) whose development was normal. In the absence of a family history, the parents were advised that the recurrence risk was consistent with an autosomal recessive trait. On subsequent examinations, the mother was found to have a history of refractive corrections since late childhood and an incomplete uveoretinal coloboma of the right eye. Both she and her son were heterozygous for a 24-bp deletion in the 3-prime end of the SHH gene coding region, which was predicted to lead to deletion of 8 amino acids near the C terminus of the autocatalytic region of SHH.

comment: In a mother and daughter with BOR syndrome (113650), Abdelhak et al. (1997) demonstrated that the EYA1 gene carried an inserted Alu element in exon 10. The inserted element was in opposite orientation to that of the gene itself, and the 3-prime sequence of the Alu element was followed by a long poly(A) tail. The features were entirely consistent with retrotransposition. A difference in length of the poly(A) tail, which was reduced from poly(A)97 to poly(A)31 when transmitted from mother to daughter, demonstrated instability. The transposition was a de novo insertion as it was not present in the DNA from the maternal grandparents. Abdelhak et al. (1997) pointed to Alu insertion as a mutational mechanism in C1 inhibitor deficiency (Stoppa-Lyonnet et al., 1990) in neurofibromatosis type 1 (Wallace et al., 1991), in cholinesterase deficiency (177400.0011), and in hemophilia B (306900.0098).

In 2 patients with a neurologic variant of Waardenburg-Shah syndrome, one of whom had previously been reported by Jacobs and Wilson (1992), Inoue et al.

In the 27-year-old male previously reported by Jacobs and Wilson (1992), the Y313X mutation was the result of a 1-bp insertion (938insA); in the other patient, an 18-year-old male, the Y313X mutation was the result of a 939C-G transversion. Both patients had muscle wasting/atrophy, pes cavus, and areflexia/hyporeflexia, indicating peripheral neuropathy. Both had developmental delay and hypotonia, indicative of dysmyelinating leukodystrophy, with nystagmus and spastic diplegia also present in the younger patient. Both patients had hypopigmentation and neurosensory deafness, indicating dysmyelinating Waardenburg syndrome, and both had long segment Hirschsprung disease.

(1999) described a patient presenting with a neurologic variant of Waardenburg-Shah syndrome (609136) characterized by severe leukodystrophy compatible with Pelizaeus-Merzbacher disease (see 312080) and peripheral neuropathy consistent with Charcot-Marie-Tooth disease type I (see 118200), in addition to Waardenburg-Hirschsprung syndrome (277580). In the patient, Inoue et al. (1999) identified a novel heterozygous 12-bp deletion in exon 5 of the SOX10 gene that did not disrupt the coding region, but extended the peptide and hence was thought to act as a dominant-negative allele. There was a 6-bp direct repeat in the wildtype SOX10 sequence that flanked the deletion, suggesting that the deletion may have been mediated by DNA polymerase slippage between these direct repeats. The healthy parents and sibs did not have this deletion, indicating that this was a de novo mutation. Deletion started at the second nucleotide of the TAA stop codon, resulting in disruption of the stop codon, and, by conceptual translation, an extension of 82 amino acids on the carboxy terminus without any other alterations in the putative SOX10 protein. The 12-bp deletion converted the carboxy-terminal codon from TAA (stop) to TGT (cys).

comment: Inoue et al. (2002) reported a male infant with lethal congenital hypomyelinating neuropathy (CHN; 605253) and Waardenburg syndrome type 4 (277580) who was heterozygous for a 748C-T transition in the SOX10 gene, resulting in a gln250-to-ter (Q250X) substitution. The patient presented at birth with a white forelock and hyperpigmented and hypopigmented patches on the face, body, and limbs, deafness, and chronic ileus. He never passed meconium and required repeated segmental small and large bowel resections. Myenteric and submucosal ganglion cells were severely diminished throughout the entire colon and much of the small bowel. In addition, he had little spontaneous respiratory or other movement, severe hypotonia, multiple contractures, undetectable tendon reflexes, and tongue fasciculations. Histopathologic studies showed an absence of peripheral nerve myelin despite normal numbers of Schwann cells, and profound dysmyelination in the CNS. He remained ventilator-dependent his entire life and died at 83 days of age of Pseudomonas aeruginosa sepsis. The patient appeared to represent the neurologic variant of Waardenburg-Shah syndrome (609136) as described by Touraine et al. (2000) caused by truncating mutations of SOX10 (see 602229.0007). The observations suggested that some SOX10 mutations, such as Q250X, may allow Schwann cells and oligodendrocytes to proliferate but interfere with further differentiation to form myelin. In contrast to SOX10 loss-of-function mutations causing only WS4, mutations associated with both peripheral and central dysmyelination may affect pathology through a dominant-negative mechanism.

The gonadal phenotype varied widely among the 3 affected sibs. The proband had 46,XY true hermaphroditism with ambiguous external genitalia. The other 2 sibs were 46,XY and 46,XX and both had bilateral ovaries with normal female genitalia. A 1-bp insertion (cytidine) at nucleotide position 1096 was detected in the affected children. Mutational analysis revealed wildtype SOX9 nucleotide sequence in the parental somatic cells but detected gonadal mosaicism for the mutation in the father's germ cells. Cameron et al.

comment: Wagner et al. (1994) reported a de novo nonsense mutation within codon 440 (Y440X; TAC-TAG) in a sex-reversed XY female with campomelic dysplasia (114290) who survived for 4 years (Ebensperger et al., 1991). Meyer et al. (1997) identified the same de novo stop codon mutation in a karyotypic and phenotypic female who was still alive at the age of 10 years. In a female infant with campomelic dysplasia and XY sex reversal, Pop et al. (2005) identified homozygosity for the Y440X mutation. Neither parent carried the mutation; analysis of intragenic SNPs suggested that the homozygous mutation arose by a mitotic gene conversion event involving exchange of at least 440 nucleotides and at most 2,208 nucleotides between a de novo mutant maternal allele and a wildtype paternal allele. The patient also had somatic mosaicism, with homozygous mutant cells constituting about 80% of the leukocyte cell population, whereas about 20% were heterozygous mutant cells; she died at the age of 3 months due to progressive respiratory compromise. Transient cotransfection experiments in mouse neuro2a cells demonstrated that the Y440X mutant retained some transactivation capacity on authentic SOX9-responsive promoters/enhancers, ranging from 5 to 22% of wildtype activity. Pop et al. (2005) suggested that this is a hypomorphic rather than a complete loss-of-function allele, which may account for the milder phenotype and longer survival seen in some patients with this mutation.

comment: Acampomelic campomelic dysplasia (see 114290) is a rare variant of the more commonly encountered campomelic dysplasia, characterized by absence of long bone curvature. Thong et al. (2000) described a patient with acampomelic dysplasia with a de novo heterozygous mutation in the SOX9 gene, resulting in a lys173-to-glu (K173E) substitution. The mutation was located within the DNA binding HMG (high mobility group) domain of the SOX9 protein. The mutation was not present in the parents. The patient's antenatal period was uneventful, apart from renal pelvis dilatation detected at 19 weeks on ultrasound scan. Soon after birth he developed severe respiratory distress requiring ventilation for 2 weeks and continuous positive airway pressure via nasal prong thereafter. He developed recurrent chest infections and feeding difficulties. Oxygen supplementation was discontinued at 7 months. Physical examination showed rounded face, flat nasal bridge, micrognathia, midline cleft palate, long deep philtrum, and small mouth. The genital abnormalities consisted of bifid scrotum, perineal hypospadias, and undescended right testis. He had deep plantar creases, mild clinodactyly, small and hyperconvex nails, and limited elbow extension. The limbs were straight with no pretibial dimples. The karyotype was 46,XY. Skeletal survey at 7 weeks showed 11 pairs of gracile ribs, hypoplastic scapulas, dysplastic clavicles with broad medial aspects, and coronal clefts in the vertebral bodies T11, L1, and L2. The bodies of the iliac and pubic bones were hypoplastic with small sacrosciatic notches. The long bones were straight with mild shortness and flare of the metaphyses.

comment: In a patient with campomelic syndrome (114290) with autosomal sex reversal, Ninomiya et al. (2000) identified a 1-bp deletion (296G), resulting in a frameshift upstream of the HMG box and a stop codon in the HMG domain of SOX9. The predicted truncated SOX9 protein contained 108 amino acids instead of the normal 509. Despite the marked change in the SOX9 protein, the patient had survived for 63 months, although requiring daily mechanical support of ventilation.

comment: In a chromosomally normal boy with acampomelic campomelic dysplasia (see 114290), Moog et al. (2001) identified a heterozygous 865C-T transition in the SOX9 gene, leading to a his165-to-tyr (H165Y) substitution.

comment: In a long-term survivor with acampomelic campomelic dysplasia (see 114290), Sock et al. (2003) reported a C-to-A transversion in the SOX9 gene that resulted in an ala76-to-glu (A76E) amino acid substitution. Dimerization and the resulting capacity to activate promoters via dimeric binding sites was lost in the mutant SOX9 protein while other features involved in SOX9 function remained unaltered.

comment: In a patient with campomelic dysplasia (114290), Sock et al. (2003) detected a 30-bp deletion in the SOX9 gene that removed amino acids 66 through 75 (delta66-75). The 30-bp deletion occurred between 2 hexanucleotide repeats, retaining 1 copy. The patient, a girl who died soon after birth from respiratory failure, had all the hallmarks of campomelic dysplasia, including bending of femora, tibiae, and fibulae. Additionally she showed the rare findings of absence of toenails and a broad gap between the first and second toes, combined with syndactyly between the second, third, and fourth toes.

comment: In an infant with campomelic dysplasia (114290), Preiss et al. (2001) identified a heterozygous 462C-G transversion in the SOX9 gene, resulting in a phe154-to-leu (F154L) substitution. F154 is a highly conserved residue of helix 3 within the HMG domain. Fluorescence studies showed that the mutant F154L protein did not have significant changes in tertiary structure. In vitro functional expression studies demonstrated that the mutant protein had a significant loss of DNA-binding activity (5% of wildtype) and a loss of transcriptional activation activity (26% of wildtype).

comment: In a patient with campomelic dysplasia with autosomal sex reversal (114290), Preiss et al. (2001) identified a heterozygous 472G-A transition in the SOX9 gene, resulting in an ala158-to-thr (A158T) substitution. A158 is a highly conserved residue of helix 3 within the HMG domain. Fluorescence studies showed that the mutant A158T protein did not have significant changes in tertiary structure. In vitro functional expression studies demonstrated that the mutant protein had a 2-fold decrease in nuclear accumulation, a loss of DNA-binding activity (17% of wildtype), and a milder loss of transcriptional activation activity (62% of wildtype).
